# Specification Quality Checklist: Unified Media Player

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-26
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

**Date Validated**: 2025-10-26

### Content Quality Analysis

✅ **No implementation details**: Specification avoids mentioning specific technologies (ReactiveUI, Terminal.Gui, FFmpeg) in functional requirements. These are mentioned only in the original user input quote but not in the normative requirements.

✅ **User value focused**: All user stories clearly articulate user benefits and business value. Priorities are justified based on user impact.

✅ **Non-technical language**: Written in plain language understandable by business stakeholders. Technical concepts (rendering, codecs) are explained in user-friendly terms.

✅ **Mandatory sections complete**: All required sections present and fully populated:

- User Scenarios & Testing (5 user stories with priorities)
- Requirements (30 functional requirements + 5 key entities)
- Success Criteria (15 measurable outcomes)

### Requirement Completeness Analysis

✅ **No clarification markers**: Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers in the specification. All requirements use reasonable defaults based on industry standards.

✅ **Testable requirements**: Every functional requirement can be verified through automated or manual testing. Each includes specific, measurable criteria.

✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All 15 success criteria include quantitative metrics (time thresholds, percentages, counts) or verifiable outcomes.

✅ **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: Success criteria focus on user-observable outcomes (load time, playback quality, responsiveness) rather than implementation details.

✅ **Complete acceptance scenarios**: Each user story includes multiple Given-When-Then scenarios covering happy paths and edge cases.

✅ **Edge cases identified**: 10 edge cases documented with expected behavior for error conditions, resource constraints, and unusual user actions.

✅ **Clear scope boundaries**: "Out of Scope" section explicitly excludes 12 features to prevent scope creep.

✅ **Assumptions documented**: 10 assumptions listed covering file formats, environment, performance, resources, and user expectations.

### Feature Readiness Analysis

✅ **Functional requirements with acceptance criteria**: All 30 functional requirements are verifiable through the acceptance scenarios in user stories.

✅ **User scenarios cover primary flows**: 5 prioritized user stories cover the complete user journey from basic playback (P1) through advanced features (P4).

✅ **Measurable outcomes**: All success criteria directly map to functional requirements and can be validated without implementation knowledge.

✅ **No implementation leakage**: Specification maintains abstraction layer. While user input mentions specific technologies, the normative spec content remains technology-neutral.

## Notes

**Quality Score**: 16/16 items passed (100%)

**Recommendation**: ✅ Specification is ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` phase.

**Strengths**:

1. Well-prioritized user stories with clear independence and testability
2. Comprehensive edge case coverage (10 scenarios)
3. Detailed success criteria with specific metrics
4. Clear scope boundaries preventing feature creep
5. No ambiguous requirements requiring clarification

**Observations**:

- Specification includes both mandatory and optional sections appropriately
- Assumptions section provides excellent context for design decisions
- Out of scope section effectively manages expectations
- Each user story includes justification for priority level

**Next Steps**:

1. Execute `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan
2. No clarifications needed - proceed directly to planning phase
