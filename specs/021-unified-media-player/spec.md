# Feature Specification: Unified Media Player

**Feature Branch**: `021-unified-media-player`
**Created**: 2025-10-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Unified audio and video media player with plugin-based rendering that adapts to different terminal capabilities (Braille, SIXEL, Kitty Graphics). Supports ReactiveUI MVVM patterns, Terminal.Gui integration, FFmpeg decoding, and priority-based renderer selection."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic Media Playback (Priority: P1)

As a terminal user, I want to play video and audio files directly in my terminal so that I can view media content without switching to a separate application.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality - without basic playback, the feature has no value. This is the minimum viable product that delivers immediate user value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading a sample video file and verifying it plays with visual/audio output in the terminal. Delivers standalone value as a basic media player.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a valid video file exists on disk, **When** user opens the file in the media player, **Then** the video displays in the terminal window with playback controls visible
2. **Given** a valid audio file exists on disk, **When** user opens the file in the media player, **Then** the audio plays with waveform visualization and playback controls visible
3. **Given** a media file is playing, **When** user presses the pause control, **Then** playback pauses immediately and the control changes to show "play" state
4. **Given** a media file is paused, **When** user presses the play control, **Then** playback resumes from the paused position
5. **Given** a media file is playing, **When** user presses the stop control, **Then** playback stops, media resets to beginning, and resources are released
6. **Given** a media file is playing, **When** user adjusts the volume slider, **Then** audio volume changes immediately to reflect the new level
7. **Given** an unsupported file format is selected, **When** user attempts to open it, **Then** a clear error message displays indicating the format is not supported

---

### User Story 2 - Terminal-Adaptive Rendering (Priority: P2)

As a user with different terminal emulators, I want the media player to automatically use the best available rendering method for my terminal so that I get the highest quality playback possible without manual configuration.

**Why this priority**: This differentiates the player from basic solutions and ensures optimal user experience across different environments. Can be developed after P1 is working, adding value incrementally.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running the same media file in different terminal emulators (Windows Terminal, Kitty, xterm) and verifying each uses the appropriate renderer. Delivers value by optimizing quality automatically.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is running a terminal with high-fidelity graphics support (e.g., Kitty terminal), **When** user plays a video, **Then** the system uses high-quality rendering with full color support
2. **Given** user is running a basic terminal with limited graphics (e.g., standard xterm), **When** user plays a video, **Then** the system uses text-based rendering that works reliably on that terminal
3. **Given** user is running a terminal with medium graphics capability (e.g., terminal with SIXEL support), **When** user plays a video, **Then** the system uses the appropriate medium-quality rendering method
4. **Given** the player cannot detect terminal capabilities, **When** user plays a video, **Then** the system falls back to a universal text-based rendering method that works on all terminals
5. **Given** user has multiple rendering options available, **When** the player starts, **Then** it automatically selects the highest-quality renderer compatible with the terminal without user intervention

---

### User Story 3 - Playlist Management (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to create and manage playlists of media files so that I can queue multiple files for continuous playback without manual intervention.

**Why this priority**: Enhances user convenience but is not essential for core playback functionality. Can be added after basic playback and adaptive rendering are working.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by adding multiple files to a queue, playing through them, and using next/previous controls. Delivers value as a convenience feature for batch media consumption.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has multiple media files selected, **When** user adds them to the playlist, **Then** all files appear in the playlist panel in the order added
2. **Given** a playlist has multiple items, **When** the currently playing item finishes, **Then** playback automatically advances to the next item in the playlist
3. **Given** a media file is playing from a playlist, **When** user clicks the "next" control, **Then** the current item stops and the next item begins playing immediately
4. **Given** a media file is playing from a playlist, **When** user clicks the "previous" control, **Then** the current item stops and the previous item begins playing immediately
5. **Given** a playlist is loaded, **When** user removes an item from the playlist, **Then** the item is removed and remaining items maintain their order
6. **Given** a playlist with items exists, **When** user activates shuffle mode, **Then** items play in randomized order instead of sequential order
7. **Given** a playlist has finished all items, **When** repeat mode is enabled, **Then** the playlist starts over from the first item
8. **Given** a playlist is created, **When** user saves it, **Then** the playlist can be loaded again in future sessions with the same items in the same order

---

### User Story 4 - Seek and Navigation (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to seek to specific positions in media files and see the current playback progress so that I can jump to desired content and track where I am in the media.

**Why this priority**: Essential for usability with longer media files. Users expect this basic control in any media player. Should be implemented alongside P1 for a complete MVP experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by playing a media file, using seek controls to jump to different timestamps, and verifying position updates correctly. Delivers standalone value for media navigation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a media file is playing, **When** user drags the progress slider to a new position, **Then** playback jumps to that position immediately
2. **Given** a media file is playing, **When** user presses the seek-forward shortcut, **Then** playback advances by a fixed time increment (e.g., 5 seconds)
3. **Given** a media file is playing, **When** user presses the seek-backward shortcut, **Then** playback rewinds by a fixed time increment (e.g., 5 seconds)
4. **Given** a media file is playing, **When** time progresses, **Then** the position display updates continuously to show current timestamp and total duration
5. **Given** a media file is playing, **When** user seeks to the end of the file, **Then** playback stops and the player is ready to restart or load a new file
6. **Given** a media file is paused, **When** user seeks to a new position, **Then** the player remains paused at the new position

---

### User Story 5 - Audio Visualization (Priority: P4)

As a user playing audio-only files, I want to see visual feedback representing the audio so that I have engaging visual content while listening.

**Why this priority**: Nice-to-have feature that enhances the experience but is not critical for core functionality. Can be added after all higher-priority features are stable.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by playing an audio file and verifying visual elements (spectrum analyzer, waveform) display and update in sync with audio. Delivers value as an enhancement to audio playback.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an audio file is playing, **When** the visualizer is enabled, **Then** a real-time spectrum analyzer displays frequency content
2. **Given** an audio file is playing, **When** the visualizer is enabled, **Then** a waveform display shows amplitude changes over time
3. **Given** visualizer is active, **When** audio plays, **Then** visualization updates smoothly in sync with the audio playback
4. **Given** visualizer is active, **When** user switches visualization mode, **Then** the display changes to the selected mode (spectrum, waveform, VU meter)

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when a media file becomes corrupted or unreadable during playback?**
  - System detects the error, displays a user-friendly error message, and stops playback gracefully without crashing

- **What happens when user tries to play a file that is extremely large (e.g., 4K video on low-memory system)?**
  - System detects resource constraints and either warns the user before playback or gracefully degrades quality to maintain stable playback

- **What happens when terminal window is resized during playback?**
  - Rendering adapts to the new window size, rescaling video content to fit the updated viewport without stopping playback

- **What happens when user switches to a different terminal while media is playing?**
  - Playback continues in the background, and visual rendering resumes when user returns to the terminal

- **What happens when system runs out of memory during playback?**
  - System detects low memory condition, attempts to reduce buffer sizes, and if unsuccessful, stops playback with a clear error message

- **What happens when audio device is disconnected during playback?**
  - System detects audio device loss, pauses playback automatically, and displays notification to user

- **What happens when user tries to seek beyond the end of a file?**
  - System constrains seek position to valid range (0 to duration) and positions at the last valid timestamp

- **What happens when a playlist contains files with different formats (video, audio)?**
  - Player switches rendering mode appropriately for each file type, showing video for video files and visualizer for audio files

- **What happens when network-mounted storage becomes unavailable during playback?**
  - System detects read failure, attempts retry with timeout, and if unsuccessful, stops playback with informative error message

- **What happens when user rapidly presses play/pause multiple times?**
  - System debounces control inputs, processing only the final state change to avoid command queuing issues

## Assumptions

1. **Media File Formats**: Assuming industry-standard formats (MP4, MKV, AVI for video; MP3, FLAC, WAV for audio) are sufficient for 95% of use cases. Exotic or proprietary formats are out of scope.

2. **Terminal Environment**: Assuming users run modern terminal emulators with UTF-8 support. Legacy terminals without Unicode support will receive degraded experience but remain functional.

3. **Performance Targets**: Assuming standard expectations for media players: sub-second load times, smooth playback at native frame rates, minimal memory footprint relative to content size.

4. **File Location**: Assuming media files are stored locally or on fast network storage. Streaming from remote URLs or slow network shares may degrade performance but is not explicitly handled.

5. **User Permissions**: Assuming users have read access to media files and write access to configuration storage location for playlist/preference persistence.

6. **Playback Model**: Assuming sequential playback model (one file at a time) rather than simultaneous multi-track playback.

7. **Error Handling**: Assuming user-friendly error messages with reasonable fallbacks align with standard media player behavior. No specialized error recovery beyond retry logic and graceful degradation.

8. **Resource Constraints**: Assuming modern system resources (minimum 4GB RAM, multi-core CPU) for optimal experience. Lower-spec systems may experience reduced quality but should remain functional.

9. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Assuming standard media player conventions (Space for play/pause, arrow keys for seek/volume) are intuitive for users without explicit training.

10. **Playlist Persistence**: Assuming JSON or similar structured text format for playlist storage is acceptable. No requirement for database or advanced playlist features (smart playlists, filtering, etc.).

## Out of Scope

The following features are explicitly excluded from this specification:

1. **Streaming from Network URLs**: Only local file playback is supported. HTTP/RTSP/RTMP streaming is not included.

2. **Subtitle Support**: Rendering of subtitle tracks (SRT, ASS, VTT) is not included in this version.

3. **Multi-track Audio**: Selecting between multiple audio tracks in a single file is not supported.

4. **Video Effects and Filters**: Color correction, brightness adjustment, playback speed changes, and other effects are out of scope.

5. **Audio Equalizer**: Fine-grained audio frequency adjustment is not included.

6. **Screen Recording**: Capturing terminal output to video file is not part of this feature.

7. **Media Library Management**: Cataloging, tagging, searching, and organizing large media collections is not included.

8. **Online Metadata Retrieval**: Fetching album art, lyrics, or metadata from online databases is out of scope.

9. **Format Conversion**: Transcoding between formats or extracting audio from video files is not supported.

10. **Multi-room/Networked Playback**: DLNA, Chromecast, or other network playback protocols are not included.

11. **Advanced Playlist Features**: Smart playlists, auto-generated playlists, or playlist sharing/collaboration features are excluded.

12. **Video Editing**: Trimming, cutting, merging, or editing media files is not supported.
