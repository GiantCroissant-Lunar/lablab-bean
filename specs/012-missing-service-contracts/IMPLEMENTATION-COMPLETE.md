## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. **UniTask → Task Conversion**
All Unity-specific `UniTask` and `UniTask<T>` replaced with standard .NET `Task` and `Task<T>`.

### 2. **IObservable → EventHandler Conversion**
Unity's `UniRx.IObservable<T>` replaced with standard .NET `event EventHandler<T>` pattern.

### 3. **Nullable Reference Types**
All new code uses C# nullable reference types with proper `?` annotations.

### 4. **Default Parameters Removed from Interfaces**
Following the established pattern from Diagnostic and ObjectPool services, all default parameters removed from interface methods to avoid source generator issues.

### 5. **Unity Dependencies Removed**
- `UnityEngine.Vector3` → Custom `AudioPosition` struct
- `UnityEngine.Object` → Generic resource types
- Unity-specific providers removed or replaced with .NET equivalents

### 6. **Simplified Implementations**
Where Unity implementations had complex provider registries or Unity-specific features, .NET versions were simplified to focus on core functionality that works across all .NET platforms.

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Testing Priorities (by service)
1. **Audio** - Test playback lifecycle, category mixing, statistics
2. **Localization** - Test locale switching, fallback logic, string formatting
3. **PersistentStorage** - Test save/load with all providers, backup/restore
4. **Resilience** - Test circuit breaker state transitions, retry policies
5. **Scheduler** - Test delayed/repeating tasks, cancellation

### Integration Testing
- Test service interaction patterns
- Test provider registration and selection
- Test error handling and resilience

---

## Future Enhancements

### Audio
- Implement actual audio providers (NAudio, BASS, OpenAL)
- Add DSP effects support
- Implement 3D audio spatialization

### Localization
- Add hot-reload support for translations
- Implement CSV/YAML/JSON providers
- Add pluralization rules engine

### PersistentStorage
- Implement encryption providers
- Add cloud storage providers (Azure, AWS S3)
- Implement migration/versioning system

### Performance
- Add distributed tracing support (OpenTelemetry)
- Implement automatic performance recommendations
- Add performance budgets and alerts

### Resilience
- Add bulkhead isolation pattern
- Implement rate limiting
- Add timeout policies
