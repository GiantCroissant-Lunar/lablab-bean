# Specification Quality Checklist: Core Gameplay Systems

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items pass validation:

1. **No implementation details**: The specification focuses on gameplay mechanics, user interactions, and system behaviors without mentioning specific programming languages, frameworks, or technical architectures.

2. **User value focus**: Each user story clearly articulates the value to players (quest motivation, character growth, combat depth, economic system, etc.) and prioritizes features based on gameplay impact.

3. **Non-technical language**: The spec describes game features in terms players would understand (quests, NPCs, spells, merchants, bosses) rather than technical components.

4. **All mandatory sections complete**: User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements, and Success Criteria are fully populated with comprehensive detail.

5. **No clarification markers**: All 54 functional requirements are concrete and specific without ambiguity. The specification makes informed decisions about game mechanics based on standard dungeon crawler conventions.

6. **Testable requirements**: Each functional requirement can be independently verified (e.g., FR-001 can be tested by creating quest with different objective types, FR-015 can be tested by defeating enemies and checking experience award).

7. **Measurable success criteria**: All 12 success criteria include specific metrics (time limits, percentages, attempt ratios) and describe observable outcomes from the player's perspective.

8. **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: Success criteria focus on player experience and gameplay outcomes without referencing implementation technologies (no mention of ECS, plugins, C#, etc.).

9. **Comprehensive acceptance scenarios**: Each of the 7 user stories has 4-5 acceptance scenarios in Given/When/Then format covering main flows and variations.

10. **Edge cases identified**: 10 edge cases are documented covering quest abandonment, NPC death, inventory limits, combat interruptions, and other boundary conditions.

11. **Clear scope boundaries**: The specification covers 7 distinct gameplay systems (quests, NPCs/dialogue, progression, spells, trading, bosses, hazards) with clear functional boundaries between them.

12. **Dependencies noted**: User stories indicate dependencies (e.g., US3 notes that quest and merchant systems depend on NPC interaction, US1 depends on both NPCs and quest tracking).

**Status**: âœ… **READY FOR PLANNING** - Specification passes all quality checks and is ready for `/speckit.plan`
