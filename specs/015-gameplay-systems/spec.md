# Feature Specification: Core Gameplay Systems

**Feature Branch**: `015-gameplay-systems`
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Quest System, NPC/Dialogue System, Character Progression, Spell/Ability System, Merchant/Trading System, Boss Encounters, and Environmental Hazards for dungeon crawler gameplay"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Quest-Driven Exploration (Priority: P1)

A player enters the dungeon and encounters an NPC who offers a quest to retrieve a magical artifact from level 5. The player accepts the quest, sees it tracked in their quest log, navigates to level 5, defeats enemies, finds the artifact, and returns to the NPC for a reward (gold, experience, and a unique item).

**Why this priority**: Quests provide the primary motivation for dungeon exploration and create a sense of purpose beyond simple combat. This is the foundational narrative framework that ties all other systems together.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a single NPC with one quest, implementing basic quest tracking, and providing a reward. Delivers immediate value by giving players clear objectives and rewards.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a player encounters an NPC with an available quest, **When** the player initiates dialogue, **Then** the quest is offered with clear objectives and rewards displayed
2. **Given** a player has accepted a quest, **When** the player opens their quest log, **Then** all active quests are displayed with progress tracking for each objective
3. **Given** a player completes all quest objectives, **When** the player returns to the quest-giver NPC, **Then** the quest is marked complete and rewards are granted
4. **Given** a player has incomplete quest objectives, **When** the player attempts to complete the quest, **Then** the system prevents completion and shows remaining objectives
5. **Given** a quest requires defeating 5 specific enemies, **When** the player defeats each enemy, **Then** the quest progress increments and displays current count (e.g., "3/5 enemies defeated")

---

### User Story 2 - Character Growth Through Leveling (Priority: P2)

A player gains experience points by defeating enemies and completing quests. When enough experience is accumulated, the player levels up, receives stat increases, and unlocks new ability slots. The player can see their level, current/next level experience requirements, and stat progression clearly displayed.

**Why this priority**: Character progression is essential for player retention and creates a tangible sense of growth. Players need to feel their character becoming stronger as they delve deeper into the dungeon.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by implementing the experience/leveling system without other features. Players can see their character grow stronger through combat alone, delivering the core RPG progression loop.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a player defeats an enemy, **When** the enemy dies, **Then** experience points are awarded based on enemy difficulty and player level
2. **Given** a player accumulates enough experience points, **When** the threshold is reached, **Then** the player levels up and receives stat increases (health, attack, defense)
3. **Given** a player levels up, **When** the level-up occurs, **Then** the player is notified of stat increases and any new abilities unlocked
4. **Given** a player views their character screen, **When** examining stats, **Then** current level, experience progress to next level, and all current stats are clearly displayed
5. **Given** a player completes a quest, **When** receiving rewards, **Then** experience points are granted in addition to any item/gold rewards

---

### User Story 3 - NPC Interactions and Dialogue (Priority: P1)

A player encounters various NPCs throughout the dungeon (quest-givers, merchants, lore characters). The player can initiate dialogue, read NPC responses, and choose dialogue options that may affect quest outcomes, merchant prices, or unlock hidden information.

**Why this priority**: NPCs bring the dungeon world to life and provide essential services (quests, trading). Without NPC interaction, the quest and merchant systems cannot function.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by placing a single NPC with a simple dialogue tree. Players can interact, select responses, and see branching dialogue, demonstrating the core interaction system.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a player is adjacent to an NPC, **When** the player initiates interaction, **Then** a dialogue interface opens showing the NPC's greeting and available dialogue options
2. **Given** a dialogue is in progress, **When** the player selects a dialogue option, **Then** the NPC responds appropriately and presents new dialogue choices or ends the conversation
3. **Given** an NPC offers multiple services (quest, trade, information), **When** the dialogue begins, **Then** the player can choose which service to access
4. **Given** a dialogue choice affects game state (accept quest, refuse quest), **When** the player makes the choice, **Then** the game state updates accordingly and the NPC remembers the decision
5. **Given** an NPC has no further dialogue, **When** the conversation ends, **Then** the dialogue interface closes and the player returns to normal gameplay

---

### User Story 4 - Combat Spells and Abilities (Priority: P2)

A player learns offensive, defensive, and utility spells as they level up. During combat, the player can cast spells using a resource (mana), which deals damage, applies buffs/debuffs, or provides healing. Spell effects are visually distinct from basic attacks.

**Why this priority**: Spells add strategic depth to combat and differentiate character builds. This significantly enriches the combat experience beyond basic melee attacks.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by implementing a single spell (e.g., fireball) with mana cost and damage. Players can cast it in combat, see mana consumption, and damage dealt, proving the spell system works.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a player has learned a spell and has sufficient mana, **When** the player casts the spell at a target, **Then** mana is consumed and the spell effect is applied
2. **Given** a player attempts to cast a spell, **When** the player has insufficient mana, **Then** the cast fails and the player is notified of insufficient resources
3. **Given** a player is not in combat, **When** time passes or the player rests, **Then** mana regenerates at a defined rate
4. **Given** a player casts an area-of-effect spell, **When** the spell is triggered, **Then** all entities within the area are affected by the spell
5. **Given** a player levels up, **When** reaching specific level thresholds, **Then** new spells become available to learn or use

---

### User Story 5 - Merchant Trading System (Priority: P3)

A player encounters a merchant NPC and can view their inventory of items for sale. The player can buy items using gold currency and sell unwanted items from their inventory for gold. Prices vary based on item rarity and merchant type.

**Why this priority**: Merchants provide an economic system that gives value to loot and enables players to optimize their equipment. While valuable, players can enjoy the game without trading initially.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating one merchant NPC with a fixed inventory. Players can buy/sell basic items, demonstrating the full trading loop independently.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a player interacts with a merchant NPC, **When** selecting the trade option, **Then** the merchant's inventory and prices are displayed alongside the player's inventory and gold
2. **Given** a player selects an item to purchase, **When** the player has sufficient gold, **Then** gold is deducted, the item is added to the player's inventory, and the merchant's stock updates
3. **Given** a player attempts to purchase an item, **When** the player has insufficient gold, **Then** the purchase is prevented and the player is notified
4. **Given** a player selects an item to sell, **When** confirming the sale, **Then** the item is removed from inventory and gold is added based on the item's value
5. **Given** a merchant has limited stock of an item, **When** the player purchases the last available unit, **Then** the item is no longer available for purchase until the merchant restocks

---

### User Story 6 - Boss Encounters (Priority: P3)

A player reaches a designated boss level (every 5 levels) and encounters a powerful unique enemy with special mechanics, higher stats, and unique attack patterns. Defeating the boss grants significant experience, rare loot, and may unlock story progression.

**Why this priority**: Bosses provide memorable milestones and challenge players to master combat mechanics. They're important for engagement but can be added after core systems are stable.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a single boss encounter on one level. The boss has unique stats and behavior, and defeating it grants special rewards, proving the boss system works independently.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a player descends to a boss level, **When** the level loads, **Then** a unique boss entity spawns with distinct visual appearance and significantly higher stats
2. **Given** a boss combat is initiated, **When** the boss acts, **Then** the boss uses special abilities or attack patterns not available to normal enemies
3. **Given** a player defeats a boss, **When** the boss dies, **Then** guaranteed rare loot drops, significant experience is awarded, and progression is unlocked (e.g., access to deeper levels)
4. **Given** a player encounters a boss, **When** the player is defeated, **Then** the player respawns at the last safe checkpoint without boss progress being lost
5. **Given** a boss has multiple phases, **When** the boss's health drops to specific thresholds, **Then** the boss changes attack patterns or gains new abilities

---

### User Story 7 - Environmental Hazards and Traps (Priority: P4)

A player explores the dungeon and encounters traps (spike traps, poison gas, fire vents) and environmental hazards (lava tiles, collapsing floors). The player can detect traps with high perception, disarm them, or trigger them accidentally, taking damage or suffering status effects.

**Why this priority**: Hazards add variety and tension to exploration but aren't essential for the core gameplay loop. They enhance immersion and tactical decision-making once foundational systems are in place.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by placing a single trap type on one level. Players can trigger it, take damage, and see the effect, proving the hazard system functions independently.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a player moves onto a trapped tile, **When** the trap is triggered, **Then** the player takes damage or receives a status effect based on the trap type
2. **Given** a player has high perception stats, **When** approaching a trap, **Then** the trap is revealed before being triggered
3. **Given** a player detects a trap, **When** the player attempts to disarm it, **Then** a skill check determines success (disarm) or failure (trigger)
4. **Given** an environmental hazard exists (lava tile), **When** the player or enemy steps on it, **Then** damage is dealt each turn the entity remains on the tile
5. **Given** a trap has been triggered or disarmed, **When** the player revisits the location, **Then** the trap remains in its triggered/disarmed state

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a player abandons a quest midway? (Quest should remain in log as "abandoned" or allow re-acceptance)
- How does the system handle quest completion if the quest-giver NPC is killed? (Quest auto-completes with reduced rewards or remains incomplete)
- What happens when a player levels up during combat? (Stats update immediately, combat continues)
- How does the system handle spell casting when the target moves out of range before the spell completes? (Spell fails, partial or full mana refund based on timing)
- What happens when a player's inventory is full when purchasing from a merchant? (Purchase blocked until inventory space is available)
- How does the system handle boss encounters if the player flees the level? (Boss remains, player can re-attempt)
- What happens when a player triggers multiple traps simultaneously? (All trap effects apply, damage stacks)
- How does the system handle dialogue interruption (player moves away mid-conversation)? (Dialogue closes, can be resumed from the beginning)
- What happens when an NPC merchant runs out of gold to buy player items? (Merchant refuses purchase or has unlimited gold pool)
- How does the system handle mana regeneration during active spell casting? (Regeneration paused during cast or continues normally)
