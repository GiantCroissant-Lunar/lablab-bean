# Feature Specification: MessagePack Plugin Serialization

**Feature Branch**: `014-messagepack-plugin-serialization`
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Status**: 📝 Draft
**Prerequisites**:

- Spec 007 (Tiered Contract Architecture) ✅ Complete
- Spec 009 (Proxy Service Source Generator) ✅ Complete
**Input**: User request to integrate MessagePack from Cysharp for high-performance plugin serialization, particularly for plugin event communication, analytics data transmission, and session state persistence.

## Overview

Implement MessagePack serialization support in the existing `LablabBean.Contracts.Serialization` system using Cysharp's MessagePack-CSharp library. This will provide binary serialization for high-performance plugin communication while maintaining the existing JSON support for human-readable configurations.

**Problem**: Current plugin communication relies on JSON serialization, which has performance limitations for high-frequency events (analytics, real-time game state) and larger payloads (session data, complex plugin state).

**Solution**: Add MessagePack as a first-class serialization format with source generator support for optimal performance, while keeping JSON for configuration files and debugging scenarios.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Plugin Developer Uses MessagePack for Event Serialization (Priority: P1)

A plugin developer wants to serialize high-frequency game events (player movement, combat actions) using MessagePack for optimal performance. They need to mark their event classes with MessagePack attributes and use the serialization service with `SerializationFormat.MessagePack`.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary use case - high-performance event serialization for real-time plugin communication.

**Independent Test**: Create a game event class with MessagePack attributes, serialize/deserialize 10,000 events, and verify performance is 3x faster than JSON with 50% smaller payload size.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an event class marked with `[MessagePackObject]`, **When** serialized with `SerializationFormat.MessagePack`, **Then** serialization completes successfully
2. **Given** a MessagePack-serialized event, **When** deserialized, **Then** all properties are correctly restored
3. **Given** 10,000 event serializations, **When** using MessagePack vs JSON, **Then** MessagePack is at least 2x faster

### User Story 2 - Analytics Plugin Uses MessagePack for Data Transmission (Priority: P1)

An analytics plugin developer wants to serialize large batches of telemetry data using MessagePack for efficient network transmission. They need automatic source generation for optimal performance without manual attribute configuration.

**Why this priority**: Analytics data involves large volumes and frequent transmission, making performance critical.

**Independent Test**: Create an analytics data model with 50+ properties, serialize batches of 1,000 records, and verify MessagePack payload is 40%+ smaller than JSON equivalent.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an analytics model with source generation enabled, **When** serialized in batches, **Then** performance scales linearly
2. **Given** complex nested analytics data, **When** serialized with MessagePack, **Then** payload size is significantly smaller than JSON
3. **Given** analytics data with nullable properties, **When** serialized/deserialized, **Then** null values are handled correctly

---

### User Story 3 - Session State Persistence with MessagePack (Priority: P2)

A game plugin developer wants to persist complex session state (inventory, player stats, world state) using MessagePack for fast save/load operations. They need seamless integration with the existing serialization service.

**Why this priority**: Session persistence affects user experience through save/load times, making performance important but not critical.

**Independent Test**: Create a complex session state object (nested collections, polymorphic types), serialize to file using MessagePack, and verify load times are 50%+ faster than JSON.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a complex session state object, **When** serialized to stream with MessagePack, **Then** file size is minimized
2. **Given** a MessagePack session file, **When** loaded on application restart, **Then** all state is correctly restored
3. **Given** polymorphic objects in session state, **When** serialized with MessagePack, **Then** type information is preserved

### Edge Cases

**MessagePack Serialization**:

- What happens when serializing objects without MessagePack attributes? (Should use contractless resolver or provide clear error)
- How does the system handle version compatibility when MessagePack schemas change? (Should support schema evolution)
- What happens when deserializing corrupted MessagePack data? (Should throw descriptive exceptions)
- How does the system handle circular references in object graphs? (Should detect and handle gracefully)
- What happens when serializing very large objects (>100MB)? (Should handle memory efficiently)
- How does the system handle DateTime serialization across time zones? (Should use consistent UTC handling)
- What happens when serializing objects with private setters? (Should work with MessagePack's member access)

## Assumptions

- Developers are familiar with MessagePack concepts and attributes
- MessagePack-CSharp library is actively maintained and stable
- Plugin developers can choose between JSON and MessagePack based on use case
- Source generators are available and working in the build environment
- Performance requirements justify the additional complexity
- Binary serialization is acceptable for the identified use cases
- Network transmission and file storage support binary formats

## Out of Scope

**Not Planned**:

- Automatic migration of existing JSON data to MessagePack
- Runtime format conversion between JSON and MessagePack
- MessagePack schema registry or centralized type management
- Custom MessagePack extensions or protocol modifications
- MessagePack streaming for real-time communication protocols
- Integration with external MessagePack tools or services
- MessagePack-specific debugging or inspection tools
- Support for MessagePack RPC or other protocol extensions

## Dependencies

- MessagePack-CSharp NuGet package (Cysharp)
- Existing `LablabBean.Contracts.Serialization` assembly
- .NET 8 source generators support
- Existing proxy service source generator (Spec 009)
- Plugin system architecture (Spec 007)

## Risks

- **Performance expectations**: MessagePack may not deliver expected performance gains in all scenarios. **Mitigation**: Comprehensive benchmarking, fallback to JSON for edge cases.
- **Debugging complexity**: Binary format makes debugging harder than JSON. **Mitigation**: Provide JSON fallback for development, clear error messages, diagnostic tools.
- **Schema evolution**: MessagePack schema changes may break compatibility. **Mitigation**: Versioning strategy, backward compatibility testing, migration guides.
- **Library dependency**: MessagePack-CSharp library issues could affect the entire system. **Mitigation**: Pin to stable version, monitor library health, have contingency plan.
- **Memory usage**: MessagePack may use more memory during serialization. **Mitigation**: Memory profiling, streaming for large objects, configurable limits.

## Notes

- MessagePack is already included in `SerializationFormat` enum, indicating prior planning
- This feature enhances existing serialization infrastructure without breaking changes
- Primary benefit is performance for high-frequency plugin communication
- JSON remains the preferred format for human-readable configurations
- Source generator integration provides additional performance benefits
- This builds on the solid foundation of Spec 007 (contracts) and Spec 009 (source generators)
