# Feature Specification: Dungeon Progression System with Stairs and Multiple Levels

**Feature Branch**: `003-dungeon-progression`
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: "Dungeon Progression System with Stairs and Multiple Levels: Players can descend through multiple dungeon levels via staircases, with each level becoming progressively more difficult. Enemies have higher stats, better loot drops, and greater rewards on deeper levels. The game tracks the current dungeon depth and provides feedback when transitioning between levels. Players maintain their inventory and stats across levels, creating a sense of long-term progression and replayability."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Descending to Deeper Levels (Priority: P1)

A player explores the first dungeon level and finds a downward staircase ('>') in a room. They walk onto the staircase tile and press the interact key. The screen shows "Descending to Level 2..." and a new dungeon is generated. The player appears at the upward staircase ('<') on level 2 with all their inventory, equipment, and health intact. The HUD now shows "Dungeon Level: 2" and enemies are noticeably tougher.

**Why this priority**: Core mechanic that enables multi-level gameplay. Without stairs and level transitions, the game has no progression beyond a single dungeon. This is the fundamental requirement that all other dungeon progression features build upon.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by generating a dungeon with stairs, interacting with the staircase, and verifying level transition, player state persistence, and HUD updates. Delivers immediate value by creating a goal-oriented gameplay loop.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a player is on dungeon level 1, **When** they move onto a downward staircase tile and press '>' key, **Then** a new level 2 dungeon is generated and the player is placed at the upward staircase
2. **Given** a player has 75/100 HP and 5 items in inventory on level 1, **When** they descend to level 2, **Then** they still have 75/100 HP and all 5 items in inventory
3. **Given** a player descends to level 2, **When** viewing the HUD, **Then** the display shows "Dungeon Level: 2" prominently
4. **Given** a newly generated level 2 dungeon, **When** exploring, **Then** the dungeon has both upward ('<') and downward ('>') staircases

---

### User Story 2 - Ascending to Previous Levels (Priority: P1)

A player on dungeon level 3 realizes they are low on health and need to retreat. They find the upward staircase and press '<' to ascend. The game returns them to level 2 with the exact same dungeon layout, enemy positions, and items they left behind. They can heal, reorganize, and decide whether to descend again.

**Why this priority**: Essential for player agency and risk management. P1 because without ascending, players are trapped in a death spiral with no escape. Enables tactical retreats and resource management decisions.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by descending multiple levels, then ascending back, and verifying dungeon state persistence and player state. Delivers value by preventing frustrating dead-end situations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a player is on dungeon level 3, **When** they move onto an upward staircase and press '<' key, **Then** they return to level 2 at the downward staircase position
2. **Given** a player killed 3 enemies on level 2 before descending, **When** they ascend back to level 2, **Then** those 3 enemies remain dead and loot remains on the ground
3. **Given** a player picked up all healing potions on level 1 before descending, **When** they ascend back to level 1, **Then** those healing potions are still gone (not respawned)
4. **Given** a player ascends from level 5 to level 4, **When** viewing the HUD, **Then** the display updates to show "Dungeon Level: 4"

---

### User Story 3 - Difficulty Scaling (Priority: P1)

A player descends from level 1 (Goblin: 20 HP, 5 ATK) to level 5 (Goblin: 32 HP, 9 ATK). Enemies become significantly tougher with each level, but also drop better loot. A level 5 Goblin has a 50% chance to drop equipment versus 10% on level 1. The increased challenge creates meaningful risk/reward decisions about how deep to explore.

**Why this priority**: Creates the core progression curve and replayability. P1 because without scaling, deeper levels feel meaningless and players have no incentive to descend. This is what makes dungeon progression engaging rather than just cosmetic.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by comparing enemy stats across different levels, verifying loot quality differences, and confirming scaling formulas apply correctly. Delivers value by creating tension and reward for depth exploration.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Goblin enemy on level 1 has 20 HP and 5 attack, **When** a Goblin spawns on level 5, **Then** it has approximately 32 HP and 9 attack (60% increase)
2. **Given** enemies on level 1 drop equipment 10% of the time, **When** enemies on level 5 die, **Then** they drop equipment 50% of the time
3. **Given** a healing potion on level 1 restores 30 HP, **When** a healing potion is found on level 5, **Then** it remains 30 HP (consumables don't scale, only drop rates improve)
4. **Given** a player defeats 10 enemies on level 5, **When** comparing total loot to level 1 enemies, **Then** level 5 enemies yield approximately 3-5x more valuable items

---

### User Story 4 - Depth Tracking and Display (Priority: P2)

As a player descends deeper into the dungeon, they can always see their current depth displayed in the HUD as "Dungeon Level: 7" and "Depth: -210 ft" (30 feet per level). When they achieve a new personal best depth, the game displays "New Record Depth: Level 7!" providing a sense of accomplishment and progress tracking.

**Why this priority**: Provides clear feedback and achievement tracking. P2 because it enhances the experience but core gameplay works without it. Adds motivation through visible progress and records.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by descending multiple levels, checking HUD display accuracy, and verifying personal best tracking. Delivers value through player feedback and achievement recognition.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a player is on level 1, **When** viewing the HUD, **Then** it displays "Dungeon Level: 1" and "Depth: -30 ft"
2. **Given** a player descends to level 10, **When** viewing the HUD, **Then** it displays "Dungeon Level: 10" and "Depth: -300 ft"
3. **Given** a player's previous best depth was level 5, **When** they reach level 6, **Then** a message appears: "New Record Depth: Level 6!"
4. **Given** a player dies on level 8, **When** starting a new game, **Then** their previous best depth (level 8) is remembered and displayed

---

### User Story 5 - Win Condition or Endless Mode (Priority: P3)

A player reaches dungeon level 20, defeating increasingly challenging enemies. They find a special "Victory Chamber" with a final boss and treasure hoard. After defeating the boss, the game displays "You have conquered the dungeon! Final Score: 18,500" showing total experience, gold collected, and levels cleared. Alternatively, in endless mode, the dungeon continues infinitely with exponentially scaling difficulty.

**Why this priority**: Provides closure and goals for skilled players. P3 because the core loop works without an endpoint - endless descent is valuable on its own. This adds structured victory conditions for completionists.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by reaching the win condition level, verifying boss encounter triggers, and confirming score calculation. Delivers value through goal completion satisfaction.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a player reaches level 20, **When** they find the downward staircase, **Then** it leads to a special victory chamber instead of level 21
2. **Given** a player defeats the final boss in the victory chamber, **When** the boss dies, **Then** a victory screen displays final stats (levels cleared, enemies defeated, gold collected, time played)
3. **Given** endless mode is enabled, **When** a player reaches level 20, **Then** level 21 generates normally with continued difficulty scaling (no victory condition)
4. **Given** a player achieves victory at level 20, **When** starting a new game, **Then** their victory is recorded in a high scores list or achievements

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a player tries to ascend from level 1 (the starting level)?
  - Upward staircase does not exist on level 1, or displays "You cannot ascend further" message

- What happens if a player descends to level 50+ where enemy stats would exceed integer limits?
  - Stat scaling caps at level 30, beyond that difficulty plateaus to prevent overflow

- What happens when a player saves and loads the game while on level 5?
  - Save file stores current dungeon level, player loads back at level 5 upward staircase

- What happens if dungeon generation fails to place a downward staircase?
  - Level generation retries until staircase placement succeeds, or manually places in largest room

- What happens when a player with a full inventory descends to a new level?
  - Inventory persists unchanged, level transition has no effect on inventory capacity

- What happens if enemies are mid-combat when player uses stairs?
  - Staircase usage is disabled during combat, or combat must be resolved before transitioning

- What happens when a player ascends to a previously cleared level with no enemies?
  - Level remains cleared, allowing safe navigation and resource collection

- What happens to active status effects when transitioning between levels?
  - Status effects persist with remaining duration (poison continues, buffs remain active)

- **SC-010**: System handles edge cases gracefully (level 1 ascend, level 50+ cap, combat during stairs) with no crashes

## Assumptions

1. Dungeon generation system can create levels on-demand with acceptable performance (< 500ms per level)
2. Memory is sufficient to store 3-5 recent level states for quick transitions (approximately 1-2 MB per level)
3. Level numbers are represented as unsigned integers (max level 65,535 or higher)
4. Staircase generation follows existing room placement algorithms
5. Enemy stat scaling uses exponential formula: `stat * 1.12^level` capping at level 30
6. Loot drop rate formula: `10% + (level * 5%)` capping at 60%
7. Item quality increases every 5 levels (levels 1-5 common, 6-10 uncommon, 11-15 rare, etc.)
8. Level transitions are synchronous (player waits for generation to complete)
9. Previous levels are stored in memory until memory limit reached, then serialized to disk
10. Victory condition is optional and configurable (can be disabled for endless mode)

## Dependencies

1. Dungeon Generation System (for creating new levels on-demand)
2. Map data structure (for storing and restoring level states)
3. Enemy Spawning System (for scaling enemy stats based on level)
4. ItemSpawnSystem (for scaling loot quality and drop rates)
5. Save/Load System (for persisting player progression and high scores)
6. HUD Service (for displaying level number and depth)
7. Movement System (for staircase interaction)
8. Combat System (for preventing staircase use during combat)

## Out of Scope

The following are explicitly NOT included in this feature:

- Side branches or alternate paths (dungeon is strictly linear descent)
- Level randomization beyond procedural generation (no hand-crafted special levels)
- Backtracking quest objectives that require ascending
- Time pressure mechanics (hunger clock, oxygen levels)
- Level themes or biomes (all levels use same tileset and aesthetics)
- Mini-bosses or special encounters every N levels
- Elevator or teleportation between non-adjacent levels
- Co-op or multiplayer progression synchronization
- Leaderboards or online high score tracking (local only)
- Permadeath mode integration (separate feature)
- Level preview or scouting before committing to descent
- Resource cost for using stairs (no gold or item requirements)
- Locked or conditional staircases (all stairs always functional)
- Descending multiple levels at once (always 1 level at a time)
