## Implementation Strategy

### MVP Delivery (Minimum Viable Product)
**Scope**: Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 (User Story 1)
- Players can pick up items from the dungeon floor
- Items appear in inventory display
- **Delivers**: Core item collection mechanic
- **Test Criteria**: Walk to item, press 'G', verify item in inventory

### Incremental Delivery
- **Phase 3**: Item pickup (P1) - First playable feature
- **Phase 4**: Inventory display (P1) - Enhances visibility
- **Phase 5**: Consumables (P2) - Adds strategic resource management

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Critical Path (Must Complete in Order)
1. Phase 1 (Setup) â†’ Phase 2 (Foundational) â†’ Phase 3+ (User Stories)
2. Within each user story phase: Components â†’ Systems â†’ UI â†’ Integration

### User Story Dependencies
- **US1 (Pickup)**: No dependencies - can implement first âœ…
- **US2 (Display)**: Requires US1 (needs items in inventory to display)
- **US3 (Consumables)**: Requires US1 (needs pickup) and US2 (needs display)
- **US4 (Equipment)**: Requires US1 (needs pickup) and US2 (needs display)

### Parallel Execution Opportunities

**Phase 1** (4 tasks can run in parallel):
- T002, T003, T004 can be done simultaneously (different files)
- T005 must wait for T002-T004

**Phase 2** (6 tasks can run in parallel):
- T006, T007, T008, T009 can be done simultaneously (same file, different structs)
- T010, T011 can be done simultaneously (same file, different structs)
- T012, T013 must wait for T006-T011

**Phase 3** (5 tasks can run in parallel):
- T014, T015 can be done together (same file, related methods)
- T016, T017 can be done in parallel (different files)
- T018, T019, T020, T021 must be done sequentially (same file, dependent logic)

**Phase 4** (4 tasks can run in parallel):
- T022, T023, T024 can be done in parallel (different files)
- T025, T026, T027 must be done sequentially (same file, dependent logic)

**Phase 5** (4 tasks can run in parallel):
- T028, T029 can be done together (same file, related methods)
- T030, T032, T033 can be done in parallel (different concerns)
- T031, T034 must be done sequentially (UI integration)

**Phase 6** (5 tasks can run in parallel):
- T035, T036, T037, T038, T039 can be done in parallel (same file, independent methods)
- T040, T041, T042 must be done sequentially (integration tasks)

**Phase 7** (2 tasks can run in parallel):
- T043, T044 can be done in parallel (same file, independent methods)
- T045 must wait for T043, T044

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing Workflow

**Test 1: Item Pickup (US1)**
```
1. Start new game
2. Spawn healing potion at (10, 10)
3. Move player to (10, 11) - adjacent
4. Press 'G'
5. Verify: Item removed from map, "Picked up Healing Potion" message, inventory shows "Healing Potion (1)"
```

**Test 2: Inventory Display (US2)**
```
1. Add 3 healing potions to inventory programmatically
2. Add iron sword to inventory programmatically
3. Verify: HUD shows "Healing Potion (3)" and "Iron Sword"
4. Equip iron sword
5. Verify: HUD shows "Iron Sword (equipped)"
```

**Test 3: Use Consumable (US3)**
```
1. Set player health to 50/100
2. Add healing potion to inventory
3. Press 'U', select potion
4. Verify: Health = 80/100, potion removed, "You drink the Healing Potion and recover 30 HP" message
5. Try to use potion at 100/100 health
6. Verify: "Already at full health" message, potion not consumed
```

**Test 4: Equip Weapon (US4)**
```
1. Add iron sword (+5 ATK) to inventory
2. Press 'U', select sword
3. Verify: "Equipped Iron Sword. ATK +5" message, attack stat increased
4. Add steel sword (+10 ATK) to inventory
5. Press 'U', select steel sword
6. Verify: "Equipped Steel Sword. ATK +10" message, iron sword unequipped, attack stat = base + 10
```

**Test 5: Full Inventory (Edge Case)**
```
1. Fill inventory with 20 items
2. Spawn item on ground
3. Move adjacent, press 'G'
4. Verify: "Inventory full" message, item stays on ground
```

**Test 6: Multiple Items on Same Tile (Edge Case)**
```
1. Spawn 3 items at (10, 10)
2. Move player to (10, 11)
3. Press 'G'
4. Verify: Selection menu shows all 3 items
5. Select item 2
6. Verify: Item 2 picked up, items 1 and 3 remain on ground
```

### Integration Testing

**Full Gameplay Loop**:
1. Start new game with item spawning enabled
2. Explore dungeon, find items in rooms
3. Pick up healing potion and weapon
4. Equip weapon, verify stats updated
5. Take damage in combat
6. Use healing potion, verify health restored
7. Kill enemy, verify loot drops
8. Pick up loot, verify inventory updates
