# Specification Quality Checklist: Inventory System with Item Pickup and Usage

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Passing Items (14/14) ✅

✅ Content quality - No implementation details mentioned
✅ User-focused - All stories written from player perspective
✅ Non-technical language - Accessible to stakeholders
✅ Mandatory sections - All present (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria)
✅ No clarification markers - Cursed items clarification resolved (out of scope)
✅ Testable requirements - All FR items have clear pass/fail conditions
✅ Measurable success criteria - All SC items have specific metrics
✅ Technology-agnostic - No mention of ECS, Terminal.Gui, or .NET in requirements
✅ Acceptance scenarios - Given/When/Then format for all user stories
✅ Edge cases - 6 edge cases identified with resolutions
✅ Clear scope - Out of Scope section explicitly lists excluded features
✅ Dependencies documented - 5 dependencies listed
✅ Assumptions documented - 8 assumptions listed
✅ Feature readiness - All functional requirements map to user scenarios

## Notes

- ✅ Specification is COMPLETE and READY for planning phase
- All checklist items pass validation
- Feature demonstrates excellent prioritization (P1/P2/P3) for incremental delivery
- MVP is well-scoped with clear boundaries
- Next step: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify` if stakeholder input needed
