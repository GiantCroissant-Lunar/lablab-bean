# Implementation Progress: Inventory System

**Branch**: `001-inventory-system`  
**Date Started**: 2025-10-21  
**Current Status**: Phase 1 Complete ✅

---

## Summary

Phase 1 of the inventory system implementation has been completed successfully. All setup and infrastructure tasks are finished, and the project structure is ready for implementing the foundational components.

---

## Phase 1: Setup & Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETE

**Status**: 5/5 tasks completed (100%)  
**Completion Criteria**: ✅ All systems registered, project compiles successfully

### Completed Tasks

- ✅ **T001**: Review existing ECS architecture in `dotnet/framework/LablabBean.Game.Core/`
  - Confirmed: Arch ECS framework with World/Entity components
  - Systems registered as singletons in DI container
  - Component structs pattern established

- ✅ **T002**: Create component structs in `Components/Item.cs`
  - Enhanced `Item` struct: Name, Glyph, Description, Type, Weight
  - Enhanced `Consumable` struct: Effect, EffectValue, UsableOutOfCombat
  - Enhanced `Equippable` struct: Slot, AttackBonus, DefenseBonus, SpeedModifier, TwoHanded
  - Added `Stackable` struct: Count, MaxStack, IsFull, IsEmpty
  - Enhanced `Inventory` struct: Items list, MaxCapacity, CurrentCount, IsFull
  - Added `EquipmentSlots` struct: Slots dictionary with CreateEmptySlots()

- ✅ **T003**: Create `Systems/InventorySystem.cs` skeleton class with constructor
  - Created file with logger injection
  - Ready for Phase 2 implementation

- ✅ **T004**: Create `Systems/ItemSpawnSystem.cs` skeleton class with constructor
  - Created file with logger injection
  - Ready for Phase 2 implementation

- ✅ **T005**: Register systems in `Program.cs`
  - Added `services.AddSingleton<InventorySystem>();`
  - Added `services.AddSingleton<ItemSpawnSystem>();`

### Commit

```
commit 3a364df
feat: Phase 1 - Setup inventory system infrastructure

✅ Phase 1: Setup & Infrastructure (5/5 tasks completed)
```

## Next Steps: Phase 2 - Foundational Components

**Tasks**: 8 tasks (T006-T013)  
**Goal**: Implement core inventory data structures and item definitions  
**Parallelization**: 6 tasks can run in parallel (T006-T011)

### Phase 2 Task List

- [ ] T006 [P] Implement Item component struct (Name, Glyph, Description, Type, Weight) - **Already done in Phase 1!**
- [ ] T007 [P] Implement Consumable component struct - **Already done in Phase 1!**
- [ ] T008 [P] Implement Equippable component struct - **Already done in Phase 1!**
- [ ] T009 [P] Implement Stackable component struct - **Already done in Phase 1!**
- [ ] T010 [P] Implement Inventory component struct in `Components/Actor.cs` - **Partially done, needs Actor.cs update**
- [ ] T011 [P] Implement EquipmentSlots component struct - **Already done in Phase 1!**
- [ ] T012 Add Inventory and EquipmentSlots to player entity in `Services/GameStateManager.cs`
- [ ] T013 Create ItemDefinitions static class in `Systems/ItemSpawnSystem.cs`

**Note**: Tasks T006-T009 and T011 were completed ahead of schedule during Phase 1! Only T010, T012, and T013 remain.

- ⏳ **Phase 3**: User Story 1 - Item Pickup (0/8 tasks)
- ⏳ **Phase 4**: User Story 2 - Inventory Display (0/6 tasks)
- ⏳ **Phase 5**: User Story 3 - Consume Healing Potions (0/7 tasks)
- ⏳ **Phase 6**: User Story 4 - Equip Weapons/Armor (0/8 tasks)
- ⏳ **Phase 7**: Polish & Integration (0/3 tasks)

### Milestones

## Technical Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- Using Arch ECS framework v1.3.3
- Component-based design with struct components
- Systems registered via Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection
- Entity references stored as `int` IDs in inventory lists

### Component Design
- **Item**: Base component for all items (on ground or in inventory)
- **Consumable**: Optional component for usable items
- **Equippable**: Optional component for equipment
- **Stackable**: Optional component for items that can stack
- **Inventory**: Player component storing list of item entity IDs
- **EquipmentSlots**: Player component with dictionary mapping slots to item IDs

### Next Phase Requirements
Before starting Phase 2 implementation, verify:
1. Locate `Services/GameStateManager.cs` to add player initialization
2. Check if `Components/Actor.cs` needs Inventory/EquipmentSlots (already in Item.cs)
3. Review existing item spawn patterns in codebase

## Questions/Blockers

None currently. Ready to proceed with Phase 2.

---

**Ready for Next Phase**: Yes ✅  
**Recommended Action**: Begin Phase 2 tasks T010, T012, T013 (T006-T009, T011 already complete)
