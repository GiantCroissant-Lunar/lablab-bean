## Phase 1: Setup & Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETE

**Status**: 5/5 tasks completed (100%)  
**Completion Criteria**: ✅ All systems registered, project compiles successfully

### Completed Tasks

- ✅ **T001**: Review existing ECS architecture
- ✅ **T002**: Create component structs in `Components/Item.cs`
- ✅ **T003**: Create `Systems/InventorySystem.cs` skeleton
- ✅ **T004**: Create `Systems/ItemSpawnSystem.cs` skeleton
- ✅ **T005**: Register systems in `Program.cs`

**Commit**: `3a364df` - feat: Phase 1 - Setup inventory system infrastructure

## Phase 2: Foundational Components ✅ COMPLETE

**Status**: 8/8 tasks completed (100%)  
**Completion Criteria**: ✅ All components defined, player entity has inventory, project compiles

### Completed Tasks

- ✅ **T006** [P]: Implement Item component struct - *Completed in Phase 1*
  - Name, Glyph, Description, Type, Weight properties
  
- ✅ **T007** [P]: Implement Consumable component struct - *Completed in Phase 1*
  - Effect, EffectValue, UsableOutOfCombat properties
  - ConsumableEffect enum: RestoreHealth, RestoreMana, IncreaseSpeed, CurePoison

- ✅ **T008** [P]: Implement Equippable component struct - *Completed in Phase 1*
  - Slot, AttackBonus, DefenseBonus, SpeedModifier, TwoHanded properties
  - EquipmentSlot enum with 9 slots

- ✅ **T009** [P]: Implement Stackable component struct - *Completed in Phase 1*
  - Count, MaxStack, IsFull, IsEmpty properties

- ✅ **T010** [P]: Implement Inventory component struct
  - Already in Item.cs (item-related components grouped together)
  - Items list, MaxCapacity, CurrentCount, IsFull properties

- ✅ **T011** [P]: Implement EquipmentSlots component struct - *Completed in Phase 1*
  - Slots dictionary, CreateEmptySlots() static method

- ✅ **T012**: Add Inventory and EquipmentSlots to player entity
  - Modified `GameStateManager.cs` InitializeNewGame()
  - Player spawns with: `new Inventory(maxCapacity: 20)`
  - Player spawns with: `new EquipmentSlots()`

- ✅ **T013**: Create ItemDefinitions static class
  - Created in `Systems/ItemSpawnSystem.cs`
  - **15 predefined items** organized by category:
    - **Consumables (2)**: Healing Potion (30 HP), Greater Healing Potion (50 HP)
    - **Weapons (3)**: Iron Sword (+5 ATK), Steel Sword (+10 ATK), Dagger (+3 ATK, +5 SPD)
    - **Armor - Chest (3)**: Leather Armor (+3 DEF), Chain Mail (+6 DEF, -5 SPD), Plate Armor (+10 DEF, -10 SPD)
    - **Armor - Head (2)**: Leather Helmet (+1 DEF), Iron Helmet (+2 DEF)
    - **Shields (2)**: Wooden Shield (+2 DEF), Iron Shield (+4 DEF)
    - **Accessories (3)**: Ring of Strength (+3 ATK), Ring of Protection (+3 DEF), Ring of Speed (+10 SPD)

## Technical Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- Using Arch ECS framework v1.3.3
- Component-based design with struct components
- Systems registered via Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection
- Entity references stored as `int` IDs in inventory lists

### Component Design
- **Item**: Base component for all items (on ground or in inventory)
- **Consumable**: Optional component for usable items
- **Equippable**: Optional component for equipment
- **Stackable**: Optional component for items that can stack
- **Inventory**: Player component storing list of item entity IDs
- **EquipmentSlots**: Player component with dictionary mapping slots to item IDs

### Next Phase Requirements
Phase 3 implementation needs:
1. ✅ Player entity with Inventory component (done in Phase 2)
2. ✅ ItemDefinitions for spawning (done in Phase 2)
3. 🔍 Locate DungeonCrawlerService for input handling
4. 🔍 Review Transform/Position component usage for item positioning
5. 🔍 Check HUD message log for feedback display

## Questions/Blockers

None currently. Ready to proceed with Phase 2.

**Ready for Next Phase**: Yes ✅  
**Recommended Action**: Begin Phase 3 - User Story 1 (Item Pickup) - MVP feature!
