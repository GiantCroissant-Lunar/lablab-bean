# Specification Quality Checklist: quicktype and Mapperly Production Adoption

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items have been validated successfully:

### Content Quality Assessment

- ✅ The spec focuses on "WHAT" (developer needs type safety, automatic mapping) and "WHY" (reduce errors, improve maintainability)
- ✅ No HOW details leaked - no mentions of specific C# syntax, Mapperly implementation patterns, or code structure
- ✅ Written from developer perspective (developers as users) with business value focus
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

- ✅ Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are concrete
- ✅ Every functional requirement (FR-001 through FR-015) is testable with clear pass/fail criteria
- ✅ Success criteria (SC-001 through SC-010) include specific metrics:
  - Quantitative: "Zero manual calls", "at least two projects", "60% reduction", "under 2 hours", "no more than 10 seconds"
  - Qualitative: "100% pass rate", "zero mentions in code reviews"
- ✅ Success criteria are technology-agnostic (focus on outcomes like "type safety", "automatic generation", "compile-time errors" rather than implementation)
- ✅ Acceptance scenarios cover all three user stories with Given/When/Then format
- ✅ Edge cases comprehensively identified (8 scenarios covering nested structures, circular refs, polymorphism, performance, etc.)
- ✅ Scope clearly bounded in "Out of Scope" section (6 explicit exclusions)
- ✅ Dependencies (4 items) and Assumptions (7 items) explicitly documented

### Feature Readiness Assessment

- ✅ All 15 functional requirements map to specific acceptance scenarios in user stories
- ✅ User scenarios cover primary flows:
  - P1: External API parsing (highest risk, highest value)
  - P2: Internal object mapping (maintenance burden)
  - P3: Future integrations (establishing pattern)
- ✅ Measurable outcomes directly support feature success (zero manual code, test pass rates, adoption metrics)
- ✅ No implementation leakage - references to "Mapperly" and "quicktype" are tool names (part of requirements), not implementation HOW

## Notes

- Spec is comprehensive and ready for `/speckit.plan`
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are concrete and actionable
- User stories are properly prioritized with independent test criteria
- Success criteria provide clear measurable targets for implementation validation
