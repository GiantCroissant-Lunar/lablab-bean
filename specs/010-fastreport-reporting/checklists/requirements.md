# Specification Quality Checklist: Reporting Infrastructure with FastReport

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ **PASSED** - All checklist items completed

### Detailed Review

#### Content Quality - PASSED

- ✅ Specification focuses on WHAT users need, not HOW to implement
- ✅ No mention of specific C# classes, namespaces, or technical architecture
- ✅ Written in plain language that business stakeholders can understand
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

#### Requirement Completeness - PASSED

- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are fully specified
- ✅ All 44 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-044) are testable with clear pass/fail criteria
- ✅ All 8 success criteria (SC-001 through SC-008) include specific measurable metrics (time, percentage, count)
- ✅ Success criteria avoid implementation details (e.g., "report generation under 5 seconds" instead of "API response time")
- ✅ 4 user stories with 16 total acceptance scenarios in Given/When/Then format
- ✅ 6 edge cases identified with clear expected behavior
- ✅ Out of Scope section clearly defines what is NOT included
- ✅ Dependencies and Assumptions sections document external requirements and defaults

#### Feature Readiness - PASSED

- ✅ Each functional requirement maps to user scenarios (FR-001-FR-009 → source generator, FR-020-FR-025 → build metrics, etc.)
- ✅ User scenarios cover all priority levels (P1: Build metrics, P2: Game stats & CI/CD, P3: Plugin health)
- ✅ Success criteria are directly measurable without knowing implementation (SC-001: "under 5 seconds", SC-003: "100% of successful builds")
- ✅ Specification remains technology-agnostic despite mentioning FastReport (treated as a tool choice, not implementation detail)

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` - no updates required
- All user stories are independently testable with clear acceptance criteria
- Phased priority approach (P1 → P2 → P3) enables incremental delivery
- FastReport mentioned as a tool selection (like choosing a database), not as an implementation detail
- Strong alignment between functional requirements, user scenarios, and success criteria
