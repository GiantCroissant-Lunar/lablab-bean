# Specification Quality Checklist: Hierarchical Dependency Injection Container System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-24
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items have been validated successfully. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase.

### Detailed Review

**Content Quality**:

- The specification focuses on what the system should do (hierarchical containers, service resolution, parent-child access) without prescribing how to implement it
- Written from a game developer's perspective with clear user stories
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**:

- All 20 functional requirements are testable (e.g., FR-003 can be tested by creating a child container and verifying it resolves parent services)
- Success criteria are measurable (SC-003: "1000+ times", SC-005: "< 16ms")
- Success criteria avoid implementation details (no mention of specific DI libraries, only behavior)
- Edge cases cover important scenarios (service shadowing, disposal cascading, scoping)
- Scope is clearly bounded with comprehensive "Out of Scope" section

**Feature Readiness**:

- Each functional requirement maps to user scenarios (FR-001-010 → User Story 4, FR-002-006 → User Stories 1-3)
- User scenarios are independently testable with clear Given/When/Then acceptance scenarios
- Success criteria define measurable outcomes (zero learning curve, no performance degradation, no memory leaks)

## Notes

The specification successfully balances technical accuracy with stakeholder accessibility. While it necessarily mentions MSDI interfaces (IServiceProvider, IServiceCollection) as these define the compatibility requirement, it avoids prescribing implementation approaches. The spec is ready for `/speckit.plan` to define the technical implementation strategy.
