# Tasks: Hierarchical Dependency Injection Container System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/018-hierarchical-di-container/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Per plan.md structure:

- **Framework Library**: `dotnet/framework/LablabBean.DependencyInjection/`
- **Tests**: `dotnet/tests/LablabBean.DependencyInjection.Tests/`
- **Solution**: `dotnet/LablabBean.sln`

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup (Phase 1) - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2)
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on User Story 1 (Phase 3) - builds on core implementation
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on User Story 2 (Phase 4) - adds cascading disposal
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on User Story 1 (Phase 3) - can run in parallel with US2/US3
- **Scene Manager (Phase 7)**: Depends on User Stories 1-3 (Phases 3-5)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all previous phases

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Foundation - global container and basic resolution
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Builds on US1 - adds child creation and parent fallback
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Builds on US2 - adds cascading disposal
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Builds on US1 - can proceed in parallel with US2/US3 after US1

### Within Each User Story

- Implementation tasks before test tasks (TDD optional for this feature)
- Core implementation before integration tests
- Unit tests can run in parallel (marked [P])
- Integration tests after unit tests

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 - Setup**: T003, T004, T005, T008, T009 can run in parallel

**Phase 2 - Foundational**: T010, T011 can run in parallel

**Phase 3 - US1 Tests**: T024-T029 can run in parallel after T023 completes

**Phase 4 - US2 Tests**: T038-T045 can run in parallel after T037 completes

**Phase 5 - US3 Tests**: T051-T056 can run in parallel after T050 completes

**Phase 6 - US4 Tests**: T068-T077 can run in parallel after T067 completes

**Phase 7 - Scene Manager**: T078 and T079-T088 implementation can overlap partially

**Phase 7 - Scene Manager Tests**: T089-T096 can run in parallel after T088 completes

**Phase 8 - Polish**: T098-T105 can run in parallel

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1-2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T009)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T010-T012) - CRITICAL
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T013-T029) - Global container
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test US1 independently
5. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (T030-T045) - Child containers
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test US1 + US2 together
7. Deploy/demo MVP (global + scene containers working)

### Full Feature Delivery

1. Complete MVP (Phases 1-4)
2. Add Phase 5: User Story 3 (T046-T059) - Deep hierarchies
3. Add Phase 6: User Story 4 (T060-T077) - MSDI compatibility
4. Add Phase 7: Scene Manager (T078-T097) - High-level API
5. Complete Phase 8: Polish (T098-T110) - Performance & docs

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 2-3 developers after Foundational phase:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational (Phase 2) is done:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 (Phase 3) ‚Üí Core implementation
   - **Developer B**: User Story 4 (Phase 6) ‚Üí MSDI interfaces (can start after US1 core)
3. After US1 complete:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 2 (Phase 4) ‚Üí Child containers
   - **Developer B**: Continue User Story 4
4. After US2 complete:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 3 (Phase 5) ‚Üí Cascading disposal
   - **Developer B**: Scene Manager (Phase 7, after US3 available)
5. **Both**: Phase 8 Polish (parallel tasks)

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently testable at its checkpoint
- Tests are included but not TDD style - implementation first approach
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently before proceeding
- Performance benchmarks (Phase 8) validate goals: < 1Œºs overhead, < 16ms disposal, 1000+ cycles
- XML documentation required for public API (Phase 8)
- Example integration recommended for demonstrating usage patterns

---
