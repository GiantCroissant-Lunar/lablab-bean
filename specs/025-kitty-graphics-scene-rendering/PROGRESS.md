### Phase 4: User Story 2 - Graceful Fallback (8/8 tasks) ✅

**Error Handling and Fallback (FR-004)**

- [x] T040: Handle SSH sessions: Added DetectRemoteSession() checking SSH_CONNECTION, SSH_CLIENT, SSH_TTY environment variables

**Key Features Implemented**:
1. Changed `_supportsKittyGraphics` from `readonly bool` to mutable `bool` for dynamic disabling
2. Added `_kittyFailureCount` counter and `MaxKittyFailures` constant (3 failures)
3. RenderViaKittyGraphics now returns `bool` success/failure status
4. Automatic fallback from image mode to glyph mode when Kitty rendering fails
5. Permanent disabling of Kitty graphics after 3 consecutive failures
6. SSH session detection with informational logging
7. Warning when Kitty support claimed over SSH (will verify on first render)

**Checkpoint**: User Stories 1 AND 2 complete - Kitty works in WezTerm, gracefully falls back elsewhere

### Phase 5: User Story 3 - Unified Tileset (18/18 tasks) ✅

**Tileset Configuration (FR-005)**

- [x] T043: Created tileset documentation at `assets/README-tileset.md` (actual PNG to be created for testing)

**Tileset Loader (FR-005)**
- [x] T044: Created `TilesetLoader` class in `dotnet/framework/LablabBean.Rendering.Contracts/TilesetLoader.cs`
- [x] T045: Implemented `Load(string path, int tileSize)` method using SixLabors.ImageSharp to load PNG
- [x] T046: Parse PNG into grid: extract individual tile sprites as `Dictionary<int, byte[]>` (tileId → RGBA pixels)
- [x] T047: Cache parsed tiles in `Tileset` class for reuse (Tileset.Tiles property)
- [x] T048: Added error handling: if file not found, return null and log "Tileset not found, falling back to glyph mode"

**Tileset Rasterizer (FR-005)**
- [x] T049: Created `TileRasterizer` class in `dotnet/framework/LablabBean.Rendering.Contracts/TileRasterizer.cs`
- [x] T050: Implemented `Rasterize(ImageTile[,] tiles, Tileset tileset)` method
- [x] T051: Iterate over `ImageTile[,]` array and look up each tile sprite from tileset by TileId
- [x] T052: Apply tint color if `ImageTile.TintColor` is specified (multiply RGB channels)
- [x] T053: Composite tiles into single RGBA pixel buffer matching viewport dimensions
- [x] T054: Return byte[] as pixel buffer

**Renderer Integration (FR-005)**
- [x] T055: In `TerminalRenderingPlugin.InitializeAsync`, read tileset config from `IConfiguration`
- [x] T056: Load tileset using `TilesetLoader.Load()` if configured and Kitty available
- [x] T057: Store loaded `Tileset` instance in `TerminalSceneRenderer` for use during rendering
- [x] T058: Log tileset load result: "Tileset loaded: {path}" or "Tileset not configured, using glyph mode"

**Key Features Implemented**:
1. SixLabors.ImageSharp integration for cross-platform PNG loading
2. Tileset class with tile caching (Dictionary<int, byte[]>)
3. TilesetLoader with error handling and logging
4. TileRasterizer with tint color and alpha support
5. Configuration reading from appsettings.json
6. SupportsImageMode now checks both Kitty support AND tileset availability
7. Shared tileset configuration between console and Windows apps
8. ILoggerFactory injection for creating child loggers

**Checkpoint**: All user stories (1, 2, 3) independently functional - Kitty rendering uses tilesets when available

### Phase 6: Adapter Integration - Build Image Buffers (10/10 tasks) ✅

**Purpose**: Update TerminalUiAdapter to build image-mode TileBuffers when high-quality rendering is available

- [x] T059: Check `_sceneRenderer.SupportsImageMode` in `TerminalUiAdapter` initialization
- [x] T060: Read `Rendering:Terminal:PreferHighQuality` config value (default: true)
- [x] T061: Log: "Renderer supports image mode: {yes/no}"
- [x] T062: Create private method `BuildImageTileBuffer(World world, DungeonMap map)` in `TerminalUiAdapter`
- [x] T063: In `BuildImageTileBuffer`, allocate `ImageTile[,]` array matching viewport dimensions
- [x] T064: Map game tiles to tile IDs: Floor → 0, Wall → 1, Player → 10, Enemy → 11
- [x] T065: Apply entity colors as tint colors in `ImageTile` instances
- [x] T066: Resolve `Tileset` from renderer and call `TileRasterizer.Rasterize(imageTiles, tileset)`
- [x] T067: Return `TileBuffer` with `IsImageMode = true` and `PixelData` set
- [x] T068: Update `RenderFrame()` logic: if `SupportsImageMode && PreferHighQuality` then `BuildImageTileBuffer`, else `BuildGlyphBuffer`

**Key Implementation Details**:
1. Added IConfiguration and ILoggerFactory injection to TerminalUiAdapter
2. Tileset and TileRasterizer initialized in InitializeAsync if image mode is supported
3. BuildImageTileBuffer maps glyphs to tile IDs, then overlays entities with tint colors
4. BuildGlyphBuffer refactored from inline code for clean separation
5. RenderViewportAsync now chooses rendering path based on capabilities
6. Configuration uses indexer access (_configuration["key"]) instead of GetValue extension
7. TerminalUiPlugin resolves and passes ILoggerFactory from plugin context

**Checkpoint**: TerminalUiAdapter now generates image buffers when tileset is available and Kitty is supported

### Phase 7: Media Player Integration (7/7 tasks) ✅

**Purpose**: Complete KittyRenderer for video playback, reusing Kitty protocol encoder

- [x] T069: Add project reference from `LablabBean.Plugins.MediaPlayer.Terminal.Kitty` to `LablabBean.Rendering.Terminal.Kitty`
- [x] T070: Implement `KittyRenderer.RenderFrameAsync()` in `dotnet/plugins/LablabBean.Plugins.MediaPlayer.Terminal.Kitty/KittyRenderer.cs`
- [x] T071: Extract RGBA pixels from `MediaFrame.Data` property
- [x] T072: Encode via `KittyGraphicsProtocol.Encode(pixels, frame.Width, frame.Height, options)`
- [x] T073: Use placement ID `i=1` in `KittyOptions` for animation (reuse same ID for video updates)
- [x] T074: Write escape sequence to terminal via `Console.Write()`
- [x] T075: Add error handling: on encoding failure, log error and skip frame

**Key Implementation Details**:
1. KittyRenderer now has ILogger injection for diagnostics
2. ConvertToRGBA method handles both RGBA32 (pass-through) and RGB24 (adds alpha channel)
3. Placement ID = 1 ensures video frames update in-place for smooth animation
4. Direct transmission mode ('d') for video frames
5. Try-catch wrapper around entire render pipeline prevents dropped frames from crashing
6. Trace logging for successful renders, error logging for failures

**Video Playback Flow**:
```
MediaFrame → ConvertToRGBA → KittyGraphicsProtocol.Encode → Console.Write → Terminal Display
```

**Checkpoint**: Media player can now render video using Kitty graphics protocol with proper error handling

## Technical Notes

### Build Status
- ✅ LablabBean.Rendering.Contracts: Builds successfully
- ✅ LablabBean.Rendering.Terminal.Kitty: Builds successfully  
- ✅ LablabBean.Plugins.Rendering.Terminal: Builds successfully
- ✅ LablabBean.Game.TerminalUI: Builds successfully
- ✅ LablabBean.Plugins.UI.Terminal: Builds successfully
- ✅ LablabBean.Plugins.MediaPlayer.Terminal.Kitty: Builds successfully
- ✅ LablabBean.Console: Builds successfully (full application compiles)

### Key Design Decisions Implemented
1. **TileBuffer modes**: Added IsImageMode alongside IsGlyphMode for clear mode distinction
2. **Kitty protocol**: Used direct transmission mode (a=T) with base64 RGBA encoding
3. **Capability detection**: Integrated existing ITerminalCapabilityDetector from media player
4. **Priority rendering**: Image mode + Kitty takes priority over glyph fallback
5. **Error handling**: Try-catch in RenderViaKittyGraphics for graceful degradation

### Integration Points
- TerminalCapabilityDetector already exists and detects Kitty support via TERM environment
- WezTerm reports as TERM_PROGRAM="WezTerm" and sets Sixel flag (Kitty detection may need enhancement)
- Plugin system uses IRegistry with Get<T>() and IsRegistered<T>() methods

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Required
- [ ] Launch in WezTerm with Kitty-enabled terminal
- [ ] Verify Kitty graphics escape sequences are emitted
- [ ] Compare visual output with SadConsole Windows version
- [ ] Test fallback to glyph mode in non-Kitty terminals
- [ ] Verify logging shows correct capability detection

### Configuration Files to Update
- [ ] `dotnet/console-app/LablabBean.Console/appsettings.json` - Add Rendering:Terminal:PreferHighQuality
- [ ] Create sample tileset PNG for testing (Phase 5)

## Blocked Items
None - foundational work is complete and US1 implementation is ready for integration testing.

## Open Questions
1. Should we enhance TerminalCapabilityDetector to explicitly detect Kitty in WezTerm?
   - Current: WezTerm only sets Sixel flag
   - Potential: Check TERM_PROGRAM=WezTerm and enable both Sixel + Kitty
2. PNG loading library choice for Phase 5?
   - Option A: System.Drawing (Windows-friendly)
   - Option B: ImageSharp (cross-platform, modern)
   - Recommendation: ImageSharp for consistency with cross-platform goals
