# Specification Quality Checklist: Intelligent Avatar System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-24
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ **PASSED** - All checklist items validated successfully

### Detailed Validation

#### Content Quality Review

- **No implementation details**: ✅ PASS - Spec mentions "three architectural layers" conceptually but focuses on capabilities, not implementation
- **User value focus**: ✅ PASS - All user stories describe player experience and game value
- **Non-technical language**: ✅ PASS - Written from player and gameplay perspective
- **Mandatory sections**: ✅ PASS - All required sections present and complete

#### Requirement Completeness Review

- **No clarifications needed**: ✅ PASS - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers in the specification
- **Testable requirements**: ✅ PASS - Each FR has verifiable acceptance criteria (e.g., FR-007 "limit of 10 interactions" is measurable)
- **Measurable success criteria**: ✅ PASS - All SC items have specific metrics (e.g., SC-002 "95% complete within 2 seconds")
- **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: ✅ PASS - Success criteria describe user outcomes, not technical implementation
- **Complete acceptance scenarios**: ✅ PASS - Each user story has 3-5 Given/When/Then scenarios
- **Edge cases identified**: ✅ PASS - 5 edge cases documented with expected behaviors
- **Bounded scope**: ✅ PASS - "Out of Scope" section clearly defines boundaries
- **Dependencies documented**: ✅ PASS - 6 dependencies and 10 assumptions documented

#### Feature Readiness Review

- **Clear acceptance criteria**: ✅ PASS - Each requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- **Primary flows covered**: ✅ PASS - P1-P4 user stories cover combat AI, dialogue, adaptation, and quest logic
- **Measurable outcomes**: ✅ PASS - 10 success criteria with specific metrics and targets
- **No implementation leakage**: ✅ PASS - Spec focuses on "what" and "why", not "how"

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- All user stories are independently testable with clear priorities (P1-P4)
- Success criteria include both quantitative (latency, performance) and qualitative (user satisfaction) measures
- Edge cases comprehensively cover failure modes and boundary conditions
- Assumptions clearly document informed guesses made during specification
