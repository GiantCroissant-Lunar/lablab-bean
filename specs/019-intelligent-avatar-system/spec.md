# Feature Specification: Intelligent Avatar System

**Feature Branch**: `019-intelligent-avatar-system`
**Created**: 2025-10-24
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Three-layer intelligent avatar architecture combining Arch ECS (entity data), Akka.NET (actor lifecycle), and Semantic Kernel (AI reasoning) to create complete, intelligent NPCs and enemies with personality, memory, and adaptive behavior in the dungeon crawler game"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Boss with Personality and Memory (Priority: P1)

Players encounter a boss enemy that demonstrates intelligent, adaptive behavior based on personality and past interactions, making each encounter feel unique and challenging.

**Why this priority**: Core differentiator for the game. A single intelligent boss provides immediate, testable value and demonstrates the complete three-layer architecture in action.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by spawning one boss entity in the dungeon and engaging in combat. Delivers a unique boss fight experience with personality-driven dialogue and adaptive tactics.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a boss entity is created with personality "Ancient Dragon, proud and cunning", **When** the player enters the boss's chamber, **Then** the boss displays a personality-appropriate greeting (e.g., "*The dragon's eyes gleam with ancient malice*")
2. **Given** the boss has 80% health and player is low-level, **When** the boss takes its turn, **Then** the boss chooses aggressive tactics appropriate to its confident state
3. **Given** the boss has been hit by the player 3 times, **When** the boss's turn arrives, **Then** the boss remembers recent combat history and adapts its strategy (e.g., switches from aggressive to defensive if taking heavy damage)
4. **Given** the player returns to fight the boss after fleeing, **When** the boss sees the player, **Then** the boss remembers the previous encounter (e.g., "You dare return after fleeing?")
5. **Given** the boss's AI service times out, **When** the boss needs to act, **Then** the boss falls back to simple chase behavior without crashing

---

### User Story 2 - NPC with Dialogue Generation (Priority: P2)

Players can engage in natural conversations with NPCs (merchants, quest givers) whose responses reflect their personality, emotional state, and memory of past interactions.

**Why this priority**: Adds depth and immersion after establishing core combat AI. Demonstrates dialogue generation capabilities on top of the foundational architecture.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by interacting with one NPC merchant. The NPC remembers what the player said and responds consistently with its personality.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a merchant NPC with personality "Cautious trader, values gold above all", **When** the player greets the NPC, **Then** the NPC responds in character (e.g., "What do you want? Show me your coin first.")
2. **Given** the player has bought items from the merchant before, **When** the player approaches again, **Then** the merchant remembers the previous transaction (e.g., "Back again? The last sword I sold you was quality, yes?")
3. **Given** the player asks about a specific item, **When** the merchant responds, **Then** the response reflects the merchant's current mood and relationship with the player
4. **Given** the player insults the merchant, **When** the merchant responds, **Then** the merchant's emotional state changes to "Offended" and future responses are colder
5. **Given** the dialogue generation times out, **When** the player talks to NPC, **Then** the NPC provides a generic fallback response without breaking the conversation flow

### User Story 3 - Adaptive Enemy Tactics (Priority: P3)

Enemies learn from player behavior and adapt their combat tactics over multiple encounters, increasing difficulty and replayability.

**Why this priority**: Enhances replayability after core features are stable. Builds on the existing AI decision-making to add learning and adaptation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by fighting the same enemy type multiple times and observing tactical changes based on player's winning strategy.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an enemy has been defeated by the player using ranged attacks, **When** the enemy respawns or a similar enemy is encountered, **Then** the enemy prioritizes closing distance quickly
2. **Given** the player frequently uses hit-and-run tactics, **When** intelligent enemies take their turn, **Then** they attempt to cut off escape routes or use area denial
3. **Given** an enemy has observed the player healing frequently, **When** the enemy is in combat, **Then** the enemy prioritizes aggressive pressure to prevent healing opportunities
4. **Given** multiple intelligent enemies are in the same battle, **When** they act, **Then** they coordinate their tactics (e.g., flanking, focus fire)

---

### User Story 4 - Quest Giver with Context Awareness (Priority: P4)

Quest giver NPCs provide quests that adapt to the player's current progress, past choices, and reputation, creating a personalized narrative experience.

**Why this priority**: Optional enhancement for late-game narrative depth. Requires stable dialogue and memory systems.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by interacting with a quest giver at different game states (early, mid, late) and observing how quest offerings change.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a quest giver has met the player before, **When** the player approaches, **Then** the quest giver acknowledges past completed quests
2. **Given** the player has completed heroic quests, **When** the quest giver offers a new quest, **Then** the quest difficulty and rewards match the player's reputation level
3. **Given** the player previously refused a quest, **When** the player returns, **Then** the quest giver's attitude reflects the refusal
4. **Given** the player asks about quest objectives, **When** the quest giver responds, **Then** the explanation is contextualized to the player's current knowledge and progress

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the AI decision-making service is unavailable (API timeout, network failure)?
  - System falls back to simple enum-based AI behaviors (Wander, Chase, Flee) to maintain gameplay
  - Event is logged for debugging but does not crash the game

- What happens when an NPC's conversation history becomes too long?
  - System retains only the most recent 10 interactions to prevent memory bloat
  - Older memories are summarized or archived

- What happens when an actor crashes during state management?
  - Actor supervision system automatically restarts the failed actor
  - Actor state is restored from the last snapshot
  - Player sees a brief pause but gameplay continues

- What happens when multiple players interact with the same NPC simultaneously (future multiplayer)?
  - Each player maintains a separate conversation thread with the NPC
  - NPC's personality and emotional state are consistent across all conversations

- What happens when save/load occurs with active actor state?
  - Actor state (memories, relationships, goals) is persisted to save file
  - On load, actors are recreated with their saved state
  - Conversations and relationships resume seamlessly

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST support three distinct architectural layers for intelligent avatars: entity data (ECS), actor lifecycle (Akka.NET), and AI reasoning (Semantic Kernel)
- **FR-002**: System MUST create intelligent avatar entities that have personality attributes, emotional states, and memory of past events
- **FR-003**: System MUST enable NPCs and enemies to make context-aware decisions based on personality, emotional state, current health, player proximity, and recent memories
- **FR-004**: System MUST generate natural language dialogue for NPCs that reflects their personality, emotional state, and conversation history
- **FR-005**: System MUST persist NPC state (memories, relationships, goals) across save/load operations
- **FR-006**: System MUST fall back to simple AI behaviors when the AI reasoning service is unavailable or times out
- **FR-007**: System MUST track NPC memory with a limit of 10 recent interactions per NPC to prevent unbounded growth
- **FR-008**: System MUST support NPC emotional state changes based on interactions (e.g., player insults NPC â†’ NPC becomes "Offended")
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow boss entities to adapt combat tactics based on player behavior and past encounters
- **FR-010**: System MUST restart failed actor processes automatically without crashing the game
- **FR-011**: System MUST bridge events between the existing event bus and the actor system bidirectionally
- **FR-012**: System MUST support different agent types for different purposes (dialogue, quest logic, combat tactics, dungeon master)
- **FR-013**: System MUST enable NPCs to track relationships with the player on a scale from hostile (-100) to friendly (+100)
- **FR-014**: System MUST limit AI decision-making to important entities (bosses, NPCs, quest givers) rather than all enemies
- **FR-015**: System MUST complete AI decisions within 5 seconds or fall back to simple behaviors

### Key Entities

- **Intelligent Avatar**: An NPC or enemy entity with personality, memory, emotional state, and AI-driven decision-making capabilities. Key attributes include personality description, current emotional state, recent memories (max 10), relationship scores with player, current goals, and capabilities (dialogue, learning, planning, adaptation).

- **Avatar Memory**: A record of an NPC's past experiences, limited to the 10 most recent interactions. Contains event description, timestamp, emotional context, and involved entities.

- **Avatar Relationship**: Tracks how an NPC feels about the player on a scale from -100 (hostile) to +100 (friendly). Influenced by player actions, dialogue choices, and quest outcomes.

- **AI Decision**: A reasoning result from the AI agent that includes suggested behavior (Wander, Chase, Flee, Patrol, Idle), explanation of reasoning, new emotional state, and internal thought (visible to player in some cases).

- **Dialogue Context**: Information passed to dialogue generation including NPC personality, current emotional state, conversation history, player input, and relationship level with player.

- **Actor State**: Persistent state managed by the actor system including recent memories, relationship mappings, current goals, and emotional history.

## Assumptions *(optional - include when making informed guesses)*

- **Assumption 1**: LLM API responses will average 1-2 seconds but may occasionally take up to 5 seconds, requiring timeout and fallback logic
- **Assumption 2**: Approximately 5-10 "important" NPCs (bosses, quest givers, merchants) will require full intelligent avatar capabilities, while regular enemies use simple AI
- **Assumption 3**: Memory is limited to 10 recent interactions per NPC to balance personalization with performance and storage constraints
- **Assumption 4**: The existing event bus (1.1M+ events/sec) has sufficient throughput to handle additional actor-system communication
- **Assumption 5**: Players expect boss fights to be challenging but fair, with tactical adaptation occurring gradually rather than immediately
- **Assumption 6**: NPC dialogue should be brief (1-2 sentences) to maintain gameplay flow and reduce API latency
- **Assumption 7**: Actor persistence will use local database storage rather than cloud storage for save/load operations
- **Assumption 8**: The system will target single-player experience initially; multiplayer considerations are edge cases for future expansion
- **Assumption 9**: Emotional state transitions should be visible to players through dialogue tone changes and combat behavior shifts
- **Assumption 10**: The three-layer architecture (ECS + Akka.NET + Semantic Kernel) will initially apply to a subset of entities rather than all game entities

## Dependencies *(optional)*

- **Dependency 1**: Existing Arch ECS system must support new bridge components (AkkaActorRef, SemanticAgent, IntelligentAI) without breaking existing entity queries
- **Dependency 2**: Event bus (IEventBus) must remain stable and support new event types (AIThoughtEvent, AIBehaviorChangedEvent, NPCDialogueEvent)
- **Dependency 3**: Access to LLM API (OpenAI or compatible service) with sufficient rate limits and quota for development and testing
- **Dependency 4**: Akka.NET packages (Akka, Akka.Hosting, Akka.Persistence) must be compatible with .NET 8
- **Dependency 5**: Semantic Kernel packages must support the required LLM providers and agent capabilities
- **Dependency 6**: Save/load system must be extended to serialize and restore actor state beyond existing ECS component data

## Out of Scope *(optional)*

- **Out of Scope 1**: Multiplayer synchronization of NPC state across multiple players is not included in this feature
- **Out of Scope 2**: Voice synthesis or audio generation for NPC dialogue; text-based dialogue only
- **Out of Scope 3**: Visual changes to NPC appearance based on emotional state; emotional state affects behavior and dialogue only
- **Out of Scope 4**: Machine learning training of custom AI models; using pre-trained LLM APIs only
- **Out of Scope 5**: Procedural quest generation beyond simple context-aware quest offering by quest giver NPCs
- **Out of Scope 6**: Complex multi-NPC coordination (e.g., full party tactics for groups of 5+ enemies working together)
- **Out of Scope 7**: Real-time player emotion detection or sentiment analysis; player input is processed as-is
- **Out of Scope 8**: Modding API or user-customizable personality definitions for NPCs
