## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational completion - MVP target
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational completion - Can run parallel to US1 if staffed
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational completion - Can run parallel to US1/US2 if staffed
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on Foundational + US2 (dialogue system) completion
- **Save/Load (Phase 7)**: Depends on at least US1 completion (needs actors to persist)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (Boss)**: Independent - only depends on Foundational phase
- **US2 (NPC Dialogue)**: Independent - only depends on Foundational phase
- **US3 (Adaptive Tactics)**: Independent - only depends on Foundational phase, builds on US1 concepts but can work standalone
- **US4 (Quest Giver)**: Depends on US2 (uses dialogue system)

### Within Each User Story

- Layer 3 (SK Agents) before Layer 2 (Akka Actors) before Layer 1 (ECS Integration)
- Models and messages can be created in parallel [P]
- Configuration and hosting after actor implementation
- Integration and testing after all implementation complete

### Parallel Opportunities

**Setup Phase** (can run in parallel):

- T002 (SK packages) + T003 (test packages)
- T005 (AI.Actors project) + T006 (AI.Agents project)
- T007 (Core tests) + T008 (Actors tests) + T009 (Agents tests)
- T010 (project refs) + T011 (package refs)
- T013 (appsettings) + T014 (.gitignore)

**Foundational Phase** (can run in parallel):

- All component creation (T015-T019)
- All model creation (T020-T025)
- All event creation (T026-T029)
- All interface creation (T030-T031)
- All message creation (T032-T040)

**User Stories** (can run in parallel with sufficient team):

- US1 (Phase 3), US2 (Phase 4), US3 (Phase 5) can start simultaneously after Foundational
- US4 (Phase 6) must wait for US2 dialogue system

**Within US1**:

- T046-T048 (agent, prompts, parser) can run in parallel
- T053-T055 (SK bridge) and T056-T065 (avatar actors) can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Boss)

```bash
# After Foundational phase complete, launch US1 tasks in parallel:

# Parallel Group 1: Layer 3 components
Task: "Create NpcIntelligenceAgent class" (T046)
Task: "Create DecisionPrompts static class" (T047)
Task: "Create DecisionParser class" (T048)

# Sequential: Implement agent logic (depends on T046-T048)
Task: "Implement DecideActionAsync method" (T049)
Task: "Implement LRU cache" (T050)
Task: "Implement circuit breaker" (T051)
Task: "Implement fallback logic" (T052)

# Parallel Group 2: Layer 2 actors (can overlap with agent implementation)
Task: "Create SemanticKernelBridgeActor" (T053)
Task: "Create AvatarActor base class" (T056)
Task: "Create BossActor subclass" (T060)
Task: "Create AvatarSupervisor" (T062)
```
