# Specification Quality Checklist: Proxy Service Source Generator

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - Uses Roslyn but that's the only option for C# source generators
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs - Eliminates 90%+ boilerplate
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - Clear problem/solution statement
- [x] All mandatory sections completed - All sections present

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - All clear
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous - 46 functional requirements, all testable
- [x] Success criteria are measurable - 12 measurable outcomes defined
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic - Focused on outcomes, not implementation
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined - 3 user stories with acceptance criteria
- [x] Edge cases are identified - 7 edge cases documented
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded - Out of scope section defines boundaries
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified - Prerequisites and assumptions documented

## User Scenarios

- [x] At least one user story defined - 3 user stories
- [x] Each story has "Why this priority" - All stories have priority justification
- [x] Each story has "Independent Test" - All stories have test descriptions
- [x] Acceptance scenarios use Given/When/Then - All scenarios follow GWT format
- [x] Stories are prioritized (P1, P2, etc.) - All P1 priority

## Requirements Structure

- [x] Functional requirements use MUST/SHOULD/MAY - All use MUST
- [x] Each requirement has unique ID - FR-001 through FR-046
- [x] Requirements are grouped logically - Grouped by category (Core, Methods, Properties, etc.)
- [x] Non-functional requirements identified - Performance goals in plan.md

## Success Criteria

- [x] Measurable outcomes defined - 12 success criteria with metrics
- [x] Performance targets specified - Build time <1s, 90%+ reduction, etc.
- [x] Quality gates identified - No warnings, 100% coverage targets
- [x] User experience goals stated - <30 seconds to create proxy

## Dependencies & Constraints

- [x] Prerequisites identified - Spec 007 and 008
- [x] Technical constraints documented - .NET Standard 2.0, Roslyn APIs
- [x] Assumptions stated - 8 assumptions documented
- [x] Risks identified with mitigation - 5 risks with mitigation strategies

## Scope Management

- [x] In-scope items clearly listed - 46 functional requirements
- [x] Out-of-scope items explicitly stated - 8 items explicitly out of scope
- [x] Future enhancements separated - Deferred features noted

## Validation Status

**Overall**: âœ… **APPROVED** - Specification is complete and ready for planning

**Reviewer**: AI Assistant
**Review Date**: 2025-10-22
