# Feature Specification: Kernel Memory Integration for NPC Intelligence

**Feature Branch**: `020-kernel-memory-integration`
**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Integrate Microsoft Kernel Memory for semantic search, RAG capabilities, and persistent memory to enhance NPC decision-making, tactical learning, and relationship memory"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Contextually Relevant NPC Decisions (Priority: P1)

NPCs make decisions based on semantically relevant past experiences rather than just recent chronological events. When an NPC encounters a situation, the system retrieves the most contextually similar past memories to inform their decision-making, resulting in more believable and consistent AI behavior.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition that directly addresses the current limitation where NPCs only consider the last 5 memories regardless of relevance. This delivers immediate, noticeable improvement in NPC intelligence.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by triggering an NPC decision scenario where relevant memories exist from earlier time periods (not in the last 5 chronological entries) and verifying the NPC's decision reflects those relevant memories rather than recent but irrelevant ones.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an Employee NPC has 20 memories including 3 customer service incidents (at positions 2, 8, and 15) and 17 unrelated task memories, **When** the NPC needs to decide how to handle a customer interaction, **Then** the system retrieves the 3 customer service memories regardless of their chronological position
2. **Given** a Boss NPC has memories of both successful and unsuccessful team management approaches, **When** the NPC needs to make a management decision, **Then** the system retrieves memories similar to the current management context rather than the most recent unrelated memories
3. **Given** a Tactical Enemy NPC has observed player behavior in various combat scenarios, **When** planning an attack strategy, **Then** the system retrieves memories of similar combat situations to inform tactical choices

### User Story 2 - Persistent Cross-Session Memory (Priority: P2)

NPCs retain their memories and learned behaviors across game sessions. When a player exits and later returns to the game, NPCs remember previous interactions, decisions, and experiences, creating continuity and long-term relationship building.

**Why this priority**: This enables long-term character development and relationship building, which significantly enhances player immersion and narrative depth. Without P1 (semantic retrieval), persistent memories would still suffer from relevance issues.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by recording NPC interactions in one game session, restarting the application, and verifying NPCs can recall and act upon memories from the previous session.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a player had 5 interactions with an Employee NPC in session 1, **When** the player starts session 2 and interacts with the same NPC, **Then** the NPC's dialogue and behavior reflects memory of the previous session's interactions
2. **Given** a Tactical Enemy learned the player's aggressive rushing tactics in session 1, **When** the player encounters the same enemy type in session 2, **Then** the enemy employs counter-strategies developed from session 1 observations
3. **Given** an NPC stored 50 memories before application shutdown, **When** the application restarts, **Then** all 50 memories are retrievable with their original metadata and semantic searchability intact

### User Story 3 - Knowledge-Grounded NPC Behavior (Priority: P3)

NPCs can query knowledge bases (personality documents, world lore, workplace policies) to ground their responses and decisions in consistent, documented information. This ensures NPCs behave according to their defined character and world rules even in novel situations.

**Why this priority**: This adds depth and consistency to NPC behavior but depends on having the semantic retrieval foundation from P1. It's a quality enhancement rather than a core capability fix.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a knowledge base document (e.g., "Employee Handbook"), triggering an NPC decision scenario covered by the handbook, and verifying the NPC's response aligns with the handbook guidance.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Boss NPC has access to a "Management Policies" knowledge base, **When** the NPC needs to decide how to handle an underperforming employee, **Then** the NPC's decision reflects guidance from the management policies document
2. **Given** an Employee NPC has access to a "Customer Service Guidelines" knowledge base, **When** handling an angry customer, **Then** the NPC's dialogue and actions follow the documented customer service procedures
3. **Given** a knowledge base document is updated with new policies, **When** NPCs query the knowledge base, **Then** they receive the updated information without code changes

---

### User Story 4 - Adaptive Tactical Enemy Behavior (Priority: P4)

Tactical enemies analyze and learn from player combat behavior patterns across multiple encounters and sessions. Enemies adapt their strategies based on observed player tendencies (aggressive rushing, defensive positioning, ability usage patterns), creating evolving combat challenges.

**Why this priority**: This enhances gameplay depth but is a specialized use case that builds on the core memory capabilities from P1-P3. It's valuable but not as broadly impactful as the foundational memory improvements.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by having a player exhibit consistent combat behavior patterns across multiple encounters, then verifying tactical enemies employ counter-strategies specific to those observed patterns.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a player consistently uses aggressive rushing tactics in 10 combat encounters, **When** tactical enemies plan their strategy for the 11th encounter, **Then** enemies employ anti-rush tactics (flanking, defensive positioning) based on the learned pattern
2. **Given** a player frequently uses a specific ability combo, **When** tactical enemies observe this pattern 5+ times, **Then** enemies adjust positioning and timing to counter or avoid the combo
3. **Given** tactical observations from session 1 show player favors hit-and-run tactics, **When** the player encounters enemies in session 2, **Then** enemies use tactics effective against hit-and-run strategies

---

### User Story 5 - Semantic Relationship Memory (Priority: P5)

NPCs maintain rich, semantically searchable histories of their relationships with other NPCs and the player. When interacting with someone, NPCs can recall relevant past interactions based on context, not just chronological recency, enabling nuanced relationship dynamics.

**Why this priority**: This is a refinement of existing relationship systems. While valuable for depth, it's less critical than the core memory improvements and can be added incrementally.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a history of varied interactions between two NPCs, then triggering a new interaction similar to an older (not recent) interaction and verifying the NPC recalls the contextually relevant past event.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** NPC-A and NPC-B have 20 recorded interactions including 3 conflict events and 17 neutral events, **When** NPC-A and NPC-B enter a new conflict scenario, **Then** NPC-A's behavior reflects memory of the previous conflict events specifically
2. **Given** an Employee NPC has a long history with the player including both positive and negative interactions, **When** generating dialogue for a new interaction, **Then** the NPC's tone and content reflect the most relevant relationship events rather than only the most recent
3. **Given** a Boss NPC evaluates their relationship with an Employee, **When** the evaluation occurs, **Then** the Boss recalls semantically relevant interactions (performance events, conflicts, collaborations) rather than just recent unrelated exchanges

### Edge Cases

- **Empty Memory State**: How does the system handle NPCs with no prior memories (newly spawned characters)?
  - System falls back to personality-based defaults when no relevant memories are found
- **No Relevant Memories Found**: What happens when semantic search returns no results above the relevance threshold?
  - System uses the highest-relevance available memories or personality defaults if all scores are below threshold
- **Persistence Storage Unavailable**: How does the system behave if the persistence layer fails or is unavailable?
  - System operates in memory-only mode with warning logs; memories are not persisted but game continues
- **Embedding API Rate Limits**: How are embedding generation rate limits handled?
  - System queues memory storage operations and retries with exponential backoff; decision-making uses cached embeddings or falls back to recent memories
- **Memory Migration**: How are existing in-memory memories migrated to the new persistent system?
  - System provides one-time migration utility to export legacy AvatarMemory entries to the new persistent store with generated embeddings
- **Concurrent Memory Access**: How does the system handle simultaneous memory reads/writes for the same NPC?
  - System ensures thread-safe operations with appropriate locking or async coordination
- **Storage Growth**: How is unlimited memory growth managed to prevent storage exhaustion?
  - System implements configurable memory retention policies (time-based or count-based pruning) with importance-weighted prioritization
