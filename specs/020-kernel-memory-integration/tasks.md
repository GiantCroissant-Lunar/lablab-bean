# Tasks: Kernel Memory Integration for NPC Intelligence

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/020-kernel-memory-integration/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Test tasks are included based on the .NET testing framework (xUnit). Tests follow TDD principles.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

This is a multi-project .NET solution with contracts-based architecture:

- **Contracts**: `dotnet/framework/LablabBean.Contracts.AI/`
- **Implementation**: `dotnet/framework/LablabBean.AI.Agents/`
- **Core Models**: `dotnet/framework/LablabBean.Core/`
- **Tests**: `dotnet/framework/tests/LablabBean.AI.Agents.Tests/`
- **Console App**: `dotnet/console-app/LablabBean.Console/`

---

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Contextually Relevant NPC Decisions (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Replace chronological memory retrieval (last 5 memories) with semantic similarity-based retrieval so NPCs make contextually appropriate decisions based on relevant past experiences.

**Independent Test**: Trigger an NPC decision scenario where relevant memories exist from earlier time periods (not in the last 5 chronological entries) and verify the NPC's decision reflects those relevant memories rather than recent but irrelevant ones.

### Tests for User Story 1

**NOTE: Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation**

- [x] T029 [US1] Add logging for memory retrieval operations (relevance scores, count) in dotnet/framework/LablabBean.AI.Agents/Services/MemoryService.cs

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional - NPCs retrieve semantically relevant memories instead of just recent ones, testable by comparing decision quality before/after

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Persistent Cross-Session Memory (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Enable NPCs to retain memories across application restarts, creating continuity and long-term relationship building.

- [ ] T040 [US2] Add logging for persistence operations (storage backend, migration status) in dotnet/framework/LablabBean.AI.Agents/Services/MemoryService.cs

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently - semantic retrieval works with in-memory storage, and memories persist across restarts when Qdrant is configured

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Knowledge-Grounded NPC Behavior (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Enable NPCs to query knowledge bases (personality documents, policies, lore) to ground their responses in consistent documented information.

- [ ] T055 [US3] Add knowledge base indexing on application startup in dotnet/console-app/LablabBean.Console/Program.cs

**Checkpoint**: All three user stories (semantic retrieval, persistence, knowledge base RAG) should now be independently functional and testable

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Adaptive Tactical Enemy Behavior (Priority: P4)

---

## Phase 7: User Story 5 - Semantic Relationship Memory (Priority: P5)

**Goal**: Enable NPCs to maintain rich, semantically searchable relationship histories for nuanced interaction dynamics.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - Can start after foundation ready
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) and User Story 1 implementation - Builds on semantic retrieval
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - Can start in parallel with US1/US2
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) and User Story 1 - Builds on semantic retrieval
- **User Story 5 (Phase 7)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) and User Story 1 - Builds on semantic retrieval
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - **No dependencies on other stories**
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Requires User Story 1 core MemoryService implementation - Adds persistence layer
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - **Independent** (can run parallel with US1/US2 if capacity allows)
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Requires User Story 1 core MemoryService - Uses semantic retrieval infrastructure
- **User Story 5 (P5)**: Requires User Story 1 core MemoryService - Uses semantic retrieval infrastructure

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- DTOs and interfaces before services
- Service implementation before agent integration
- Core functionality before integration points
- Logging and error handling after core logic
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Unit test for MemoryService.StoreMemoryAsync in dotnet/framework/tests/LablabBean.AI.Agents.Tests/Services/MemoryServiceTests.cs"
Task: "Unit test for MemoryService.RetrieveRelevantMemoriesAsync in dotnet/framework/tests/LablabBean.AI.Agents.Tests/Services/MemoryServiceTests.cs"
Task: "Integration test for semantic memory retrieval in dotnet/framework/tests/LablabBean.AI.Agents.Tests/Integration/SemanticRetrievalTests.cs"

# After core MemoryService implementation (T021-T023), launch agent updates in parallel:
Task: "Update EmployeeIntelligenceAgent.GetDecisionAsync to use IMemoryService.RetrieveRelevantMemoriesAsync"
Task: "Update BossIntelligenceAgent.GetDecisionAsync to use IMemoryService.RetrieveRelevantMemoriesAsync"

# Launch dual-write implementations in parallel:
Task: "Add dual-write logic in EmployeeIntelligenceAgent.cs"
Task: "Add dual-write logic in BossIntelligenceAgent.cs"
```

---

## Parallel Example: After Foundational Complete

```bash
# With 3 developers, after Phase 2 completion:

Developer A (US1 - Semantic Retrieval):
- T018-T020 (tests)
- T021-T029 (implementation)

Developer B (US3 - Knowledge Base RAG):
- T041-T043 (tests)
- T044-T055 (implementation)

Developer C (Setup for US2):
- T032-T035 (Qdrant packages and config)
- T036 (docker-compose)

# Then after US1 completes, Developer A moves to US2 implementation
# Or Developer A picks up US4/US5 if US3 is higher priority than US2 persistence
```

- **Deliverable**: NPCs make contextually relevant decisions using semantic memory retrieval
- **Value**: Immediate, noticeable improvement in NPC intelligence

---

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies - safe to parallelize
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability and independent testing
- **Tests**: Follow TDD - write tests first, verify they fail, then implement
- **Checkpoints**: Stop after each user story phase to validate independently
- **Commits**: Commit after each task or logical group for rollback safety
- **Migration**: Dual-write approach (Phase 3) ensures zero data loss during transition
- **Storage**: Start with SimpleVectorDb (in-memory) for Phases 1-3, add Qdrant in Phase 4
- **User Story Independence**: US1 and US3 are fully independent; US2, US4, US5 build on US1 foundation

**Success Metrics**:

- Memory retrieval relevance score: >0.7 average (US1)
- Memory persistence: 100% across restarts (US2)
- Knowledge base answers: 95% grounded in citations (US3)
- Tactical adaptation: 50% of enemies employ counter-tactics after 5+ observations (US4)
- Relationship-aware dialogue: 80% of interactions reflect relevant history (US5)
