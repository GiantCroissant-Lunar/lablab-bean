# Specification Quality Checklist: Tiered Contract Architecture (Expanded)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Updated**: 2025-10-21 (Expanded scope)
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED (Expanded Scope)

**Details**:

### Content Quality - PASSED
- Specification is technology-agnostic, focusing on "what" not "how"
- Written for plugin developers as stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete
- No mention of specific implementation technologies beyond what's necessary for context
- Expanded scope maintains same quality standards as original

### Requirement Completeness - PASSED
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- All **77 functional requirements** are testable and specific (expanded from 37)
- Success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (e.g., "under 10ms", "90% cache hit rate", "under 2 hours")
- Success criteria avoid implementation details (focus on developer experience and performance outcomes)
- **7 user stories** with complete acceptance scenarios (expanded from 4):
  - P1: Analytics Plugin Using Events
  - P2: Game Service Contract
  - P2: UI Plugin with Events
  - P1: Scene Management Contract (NEW)
  - P1: Input Handling Contract (NEW)
  - P1: Configuration Contract (NEW)
  - P1: Resource Loading Contract (NEW)
- **24 edge cases** identified with expected behaviors across all 6 contract domains (expanded from 6)
- Out of Scope section clearly bounds the feature with deferred vs not-planned items
- Dependencies and Assumptions sections are comprehensive and updated for new contracts

### Feature Readiness - PASSED
- Functional requirements organized into logical groups:
  - Event Bus Foundation (8 FRs)
  - Domain Contract Assemblies (10 FRs)
  - Event Definitions (11 FRs)
  - Service Contract Patterns (6 FRs)
  - Scene Contract (7 FRs) - NEW
  - Input Contract (8 FRs) - NEW
  - Config Contract (8 FRs) - NEW
  - Resource Contract (8 FRs) - NEW
  - Registry Integration (5 FRs)
  - Migration & Compatibility (6 FRs)
- User scenarios are prioritized (P1, P2) and independently testable
- Success criteria map to user value across all domains
- Specification maintains technology-agnostic language throughout
- **14 success criteria** covering Event Bus, Domain Contracts, Configuration, Resources, and Developer Experience

### Scope Expansion Summary

**Original Spec**:
- 2 contract assemblies (Game, UI)
- 37 functional requirements
- 4 user stories
- 6 edge cases
- 8 success criteria

**Expanded Spec**:
- **6 contract assemblies** (Game, UI, Scene, Input, Config, Resource)
- **77 functional requirements** (+40)
- **7 user stories** (+3)
- **24 edge cases** (+18)
- **14 success criteria** (+6)

**Rationale for Expansion**:
- Gap analysis with cross-milo revealed 13 missing contracts
- Scene, Input, Config, Resource are essential for functional dungeon crawler
- All 4 new contracts are P1 priority based on dungeon crawler requirements
- Comprehensive contract foundation enables parallel plugin development
- Better alignment with proven cross-milo architecture patterns

## Notes

- Specification successfully incorporates patterns from cross-milo reference architecture while remaining implementation-agnostic
- The focus on "plugin developers" as the primary users is clear and consistent
- Event-driven architecture and domain contracts are well-defined without prescribing specific implementation approaches
- Expanded scope is justified by gap analysis and dungeon crawler requirements
- Implementation can be phased (EventBus → Game/UI → Scene/Input → Config/Resource)
- Ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` phase with comprehensive contract foundation
