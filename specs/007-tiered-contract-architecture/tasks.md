# Tasks: Tiered Contract Architecture

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/007-tiered-contract-architecture/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ‚úÖ, spec.md ‚úÖ, research.md ‚úÖ, data-model.md ‚úÖ, contracts/ ‚úÖ

**Tests**: Tests are included per spec requirements (FR-033 through FR-037, SC-003, SC-004, SC-008)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Plugin framework architecture (multi-assembly)
- Paths: `dotnet/framework/`, `dotnet/tests/`, `plugins/`

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - UI Plugin with Events (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Enable plugin developers to create UI rendering plugins that automatically update when game state changes via event subscriptions

**Independent Test**: Publish game state change events from a mock game service, have the UI plugin subscribe to those events, and verify the UI updates are triggered without the UI polling the game state

**Success Criteria** (from spec.md):
- UI plugin subscribes to game events and updates display reactively

- [ ] T073 [US3] Write integration test: System handles missing UI subscriber gracefully in `dotnet/tests/LablabBean.Plugins.Core.Tests/ReactiveUIIntegrationTests.cs`

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 3 should be fully functional - UI plugin reactively updates based on game events

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Scene Management Contracts (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Enable plugin developers to create scene/level management systems with contracts for loading dungeons, managing cameras, and handling transitions

**Independent Test**: Create the `LablabBean.Contracts.Scene` assembly, implement a basic scene loader, and verify scene load/unload operations work through the contract interface

**Note**: Per spec.md "Out of Scope", Scene contract assembly is deferred to future iteration. This phase is included for completeness but marked as optional.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (Analytics Plugin): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
  - User Story 2 (Game Service Contract): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
  - User Story 3 (UI Plugin with Events): Can start after Foundational - May use events from US1, but independently testable
  - User Story 4 (Scene Management): DEFERRED to future iteration
- **Performance Validation (Phase 7)**: Depends on Foundational (EventBus implementation)
- **Documentation (Phase 8)**: Can start after any user story is complete, but best after US1-US3
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - ‚úÖ No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - ‚úÖ No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - ‚úÖ Uses events from US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: DEFERRED - Not part of initial implementation

### Within Each User Story

- Event/model definitions before service implementations
- Service implementations before plugin implementations
- Plugin implementations before integration tests
- Tests should pass before moving to next story

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**:
- T003 and T004 (test project creation) can run in parallel
- T005 and T006 (configuration) can run in parallel

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**:
- T010-T014 (all EventBus unit tests) can run in parallel after T008 is complete

**Phase 3 (User Story 1)**:
- T016-T019 (all event definitions) can run in parallel
- T026-T028 (all integration tests) can run in parallel after implementation

**Phase 4 (User Story 2)**:
- T029-T034 (all model/event definitions) can run in parallel
- T046-T048 (all contract tests) can run in parallel

**Phase 5 (User Story 3)**:
- T051-T056 (all model/event definitions) can run in parallel
- T069-T070 (contract tests) can run in parallel

**Phase 7 (Performance)**:
- T077 and T078 (performance tests) can run in parallel

**Phase 8 (Documentation)**:
- T082-T085 (all example plugins) can run in parallel

**Phase 9 (Polish)**:
- T089, T090, T092, T093 (documentation tasks) can run in parallel

**Cross-Story Parallelism**:
- After Foundational phase completes, User Stories 1, 2, and 3 can all be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all event definitions for User Story 1 together:
Task T016: "Create Position record in dotnet/framework/LablabBean.Contracts.Game/Models/Position.cs"
Task T017: "Create EntitySpawnedEvent record in dotnet/framework/LablabBean.Contracts.Game/Events/EntitySpawnedEvent.cs"
Task T018: "Create EntityMovedEvent record in dotnet/framework/LablabBean.Contracts.Game/Events/EntityMovedEvent.cs"
Task T019: "Create CombatEvent record in dotnet/framework/LablabBean.Contracts.Game/Events/CombatEvent.cs"

# Then launch all integration tests together after implementation:
Task T026: "Create integration test: Publisher plugin publishes event, analytics plugin receives it"
Task T027: "Verify analytics plugin tracks events without direct game plugin dependency"
Task T028: "Verify multiple subscribers receive events without interference"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (6 tasks)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (9 tasks) - CRITICAL - blocks all stories
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (13 tasks)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Demo analytics plugin tracking game events
6. **Decision Point**: Ship MVP or continue to User Story 2

**MVP Scope**: 28 tasks (Setup + Foundational + US1)  
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 days for experienced developer

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Foundation** (Phases 1-2): Setup + EventBus ‚Üí Foundation ready (15 tasks)
2. **MVP** (Phase 3): Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Demo analytics plugin (13 tasks)
3. **Iteration 2** (Phase 4): Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Demo game service contracts (22 tasks)
4. **Iteration 3** (Phase 5): Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Demo reactive UI (25 tasks)
5. **Polish** (Phases 7-9): Performance + Documentation + Polish (20 tasks)

Each iteration adds value without breaking previous stories.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **Team completes Setup + Foundational together** (Phases 1-2)
2. **Once Foundational is done, parallelize**:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Analytics Plugin)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Game Service Contract)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (UI Plugin with Events)
3. **Reconvene for integration**: Verify all stories work together
4. **Final push**: Performance + Documentation + Polish

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Foundational phase (Phase 2) is CRITICAL - blocks all user stories
- User Story 4 (Scene Management) is DEFERRED per spec.md "Out of Scope"
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Performance targets: <10ms event publishing, 1000 events/second (SC-003, SC-004)
- Documentation target: Plugin creation in <30 minutes (SC-008)
