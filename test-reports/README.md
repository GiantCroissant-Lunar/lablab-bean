# Test Reports Directory

This directory contains test execution reports and logs.

## Structure

Reports are organized by timestamp in the format `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/`:

- `verification-results.txt` - App verification test results
- Additional logs and reports as generated by test scripts

## Cleanup

Old test reports can be safely deleted to save disk space. The test scripts will create new timestamped directories as needed.
