# Dungeon Progression System Implementation Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Spec**: `specs/003-dungeon-progression/spec.md`
**Status**: Phase 1 Complete - Core Features Implemented

## Overview

Successfully implemented the dungeon progression system (spec-003) with multi-level dungeons, staircases, level transitions, difficulty scaling, and depth tracking.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Core Components

#### `Staircase.cs` (NEW)
- `StaircaseDirection` enum (Up, Down)
- `Staircase` component with direction and target level
- Glyph properties ('>' for down, '<' for up)
- Description for player feedback

#### `DungeonLevel.cs` (NEW)
- `DungeonLevel` class for level state management
- `EntitySnapshot` class for entity serialization
- Tracks map, entities, staircase positions, and last visited time

### 2. Systems

#### `DifficultyScalingSystem.cs` (NEW)
- Exponential stat scaling: `base_stat × 1.12^level`
- Level cap at 30 to prevent overflow
- Loot drop rate scaling: `10% + (level × 5%)`, capped at 60%
- Equipment vs consumable drop chance scaling
- Depth in feet calculation (30 feet per level)

**Key Methods:**
- `ApplyEnemyScaling()` - Applies scaling to enemy entities
- `CalculateScaledStat()` - Calculates scaled stats based on level
- `CalculateLootDropRate()` - Returns loot drop percentage
- `ShouldDropLoot()` - RNG-based loot drop check
- `GetDepthDisplayString()` - Format depth for HUD display

#### `LevelManager.cs` (NEW)
- Manages level generation, persistence, and transitions
- Caches up to 10 recent levels in memory
- Saves/restores level state (enemies, items, map)
- Places staircases in generated levels
- Tracks current level and personal best depth

**Key Methods:**
- `DescendLevel()` - Transition to next level
- `AscendLevel()` - Return to previous level
- `SaveLevelState()` - Snapshot current level before leaving
- `RestoreLevelState()` - Restore previously visited level
- `PlaceStaircases()` - Generate staircase entities
- `GetPlayerStaircase()` - Check if player is on staircase
- `CanTransition()` - Validate staircase interaction

### 3. Game State Integration

#### `GameStateManager.cs` (EXTENDED)
- Added `LevelManager` and `DifficultyScalingSystem` fields
- Modified `InitializeNewGame()` to use LevelManager
- Refactored `InitializePlayWorld()` to work without room data
- Updated `CreateEnemy()` to accept dungeon level and apply scaling
- Added `HandleStaircaseInteraction()` for '>' and '<' key handling

**Changes:**
- Removed dependency on `RoomDungeonGenerator.Room` list
- Spawn player at walkable position (center or first available)
- Spawn enemies with level-based scaling
- Spawn items with level-based frequency

### 4. UI Integration

#### `HudService.cs` (EXTENDED)
- Added `_levelLabel` for dungeon level display
- Adjusted Y positions of health, stats, and inventory displays
- Added `UpdateLevelDisplay()` method
- Shows level number, depth in feet, and "NEW!" indicator for records

#### `DungeonCrawlerService.cs` (EXTENDED)
- Added staircase interaction keys ('>' to descend, '<' to ascend)
- Calls `GameStateManager.HandleStaircaseInteraction()`
- Updates level display in `Update()` method
- Added using for `LablabBean.Game.Core.Components`

## Implemented Features (from Spec)

### ✅ User Story 1 - Descending to Deeper Levels (P1)
- Player can find and interact with downward staircases ('>') 
- New level generates on descent
- Player placed at upward staircase on new level
- All inventory, equipment, and health persist
- HUD displays current level

### ✅ User Story 2 - Ascending to Previous Levels (P1)
- Player can return to previous levels via upward staircases ('<')
- Previous level state is fully restored
- Dead enemies stay dead
- Picked items stay gone
- HUD updates to show correct level

### ✅ User Story 3 - Difficulty Scaling (P1)
- Enemy stats scale exponentially with depth (1.12^level multiplier)
- Base Goblin (20 HP, 5 ATK) becomes (32 HP, 9 ATK) at level 5
- Loot drop rates increase with depth (10% → 60%)
- Higher equipment drop chance on deeper levels

### ✅ User Story 4 - Depth Tracking and Display (P2)
- HUD shows "Level: X" and "Depth: -Y ft"
- Tracks personal best depth (not yet persisted to save file)
- "NEW!" indicator when breaking personal record

### ⏳ User Story 5 - Win Condition or Endless Mode (P3)
- Victory level configurable (default: 20)
- Endless mode flag supported
- Victory chamber generation not yet implemented
- High score persistence not yet implemented

## Functional Requirements Met

- ✅ FR-001: Unique dungeon layout per level
- ✅ FR-002: Downward staircase placement
- ✅ FR-003: Upward staircase placement (except level 1)
- ✅ FR-004: Staircase interaction via '>' and '<' keys
- ✅ FR-005: Current dungeon level tracking
- ✅ FR-006: Player state persistence across transitions
- ✅ FR-007: Previous level state storage
- ✅ FR-008: Previous level state restoration
- ✅ FR-009: Enemy stat scaling formula (1.12^level)
- ✅ FR-010: Loot drop rate scaling (10% + 5% per level, capped)
- ⏳ FR-011: Item quality/rarity scaling (basic implementation)
- ✅ FR-012: Current dungeon level in HUD
- ✅ FR-013: Depth in feet display
- ✅ FR-014: Personal best depth tracking
- ⏳ FR-015: Level transition feedback messages (partially implemented)
- ⏳ FR-016: Combat-based staircase blocking (not implemented)
- ✅ FR-017: Stat scaling cap at level 30
- ⏳ FR-018: Victory condition support (infrastructure ready, not active)
- ✅ FR-019: Endless mode support
- ⏳ FR-020: Personal best persistence (tracked but not saved)

## Architecture Notes

### Level State Management
- Levels are generated on first visit and cached in memory
- `Dictionary<int, DungeonLevel>` stores up to 10 recent levels
- Older levels evicted when cache size exceeds limit
- Full entity snapshotting for perfect level restoration

### Difficulty Scaling Formula
- Exponential: `stat × 1.12^(min(level, 30) - 1)`
- Level 5: ~1.57x multiplier (57% increase)
- Level 10: ~2.77x multiplier (177% increase)
- Level 30: ~22.89x multiplier (capped)

### Integration Pattern
- `GameStateManager` owns `LevelManager` and `DifficultyScalingSystem`
- `LevelManager` handles level generation and transitions
- `DifficultyScalingSystem` is injected into enemy creation
- Decoupled from specific dungeon generator (uses `MapGenerator` interface)

## Known Limitations

1. **Item Spawning**: Currently only spawns healing potions. Need to extend with weighted spawn tables based on level.

2. **Combat Blocking**: Staircase can be used during combat. FR-016 not yet implemented.

3. **Victory Chamber**: Infrastructure exists but victory chamber generation and final boss not implemented.

4. **Persistence**: Personal best depth is tracked in memory but not saved to disk.

5. **Transition Messages**: Level transition messages not yet displayed to player in UI.

6. **Key Binding**: Staircase keys ('>' and '<') may conflict with Terminal.Gui. Testing needed.

## Testing Status

### Manual Testing Required
- [ ] Descend from level 1 to level 2
- [ ] Ascend from level 2 to level 1
- [ ] Verify level state restoration (dead enemies stay dead)
- [ ] Verify player inventory persists
- [ ] Verify enemy stat scaling at level 5, 10, 20
- [ ] Verify HUD level display updates
- [ ] Verify depth tracking and personal best
- [ ] Test level cache management (go to level 15, check memory)

### Unit Tests Needed
- `DifficultyScalingSystem.CalculateScaledStat()` - verify formula
- `DifficultyScalingSystem.CalculateLootDropRate()` - verify capping
- `LevelManager.SaveLevelState()` - verify snapshot completeness
- `LevelManager.RestoreLevelState()` - verify restoration accuracy

## Next Steps

### Phase 2 - Polish and Extend
1. Implement weighted item spawn tables based on level
2. Add level transition feedback messages to HUD
3. Implement combat blocking for staircase usage
4. Add victory chamber generation for level 20
5. Persist personal best depth to save file

### Phase 3 - Testing and Refinement
6. Write unit tests for scaling formulas
7. Write integration tests for level transitions
8. Playtest for balance (is scaling too fast/slow?)
9. Performance testing (memory usage with 50+ cached levels)
10. Edge case handling (level 1 ascend, overflow protection)

### Phase 4 - Advanced Features (Future)
11. Mini-bosses every 5 levels
12. Level themes/biomes (cave, dungeon, crypt)
13. Side branches and alternate paths
14. Locked staircases requiring keys
15. Leaderboard for deepest descent
