/// <summary>
/// Event bus for publish-subscribe communication between plugins.
/// Enables loose coupling via asynchronous event delivery.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The event bus provides a central mechanism for plugins to communicate without
/// direct dependencies. Publishers emit events, and subscribers receive them
/// asynchronously.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Key characteristics:
/// - Sequential execution: Subscribers execute in order, not in parallel
/// - Error isolation: Exceptions in one subscriber don't affect others
/// - No persistence: Events are in-memory only, not stored
/// - Thread-safe: Supports concurrent publishing from multiple plugins
/// </para>
/// </remarks>
