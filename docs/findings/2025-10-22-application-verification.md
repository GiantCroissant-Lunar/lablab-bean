# Application Verification After Spec Implementation

**Date**: 2025-10-22  
**Task**: Verify console and Windows applications still run after implementing specs

## Summary

Successfully verified both applications after completing spec implementations (specs 001-009). Found and resolved issues in the Windows application.

## Applications Tested

### 1. LablabBean.Console (Terminal UI)
- **Status**: ✅ Running Successfully
- **Location**: `dotnet/console-app/LablabBean.Console`
- **Issues Found**: None
- **Build Status**: Clean build with 1 warning (ref mismatch in GameWorldManager)

### 2. LablabBean.Windows (SadConsole/MonoGame)
- **Status**: ✅ Running Successfully  
- **Location**: `dotnet/windows-app/LablabBean.Windows`
- **Issues Found and Fixed**: 2 issues
- **Build Status**: Clean build

## Issues Found and Resolved

### Issue 1: Missing MonoGame.Framework Dependency
**Error**:
```
System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not load file or assembly 'MonoGame.Framework, Version=3.8.1.303'
```

**Root Cause**: `SadConsole.Host.MonoGame` package reference didn't automatically pull in `MonoGame.Framework.DesktopGL` as a transitive dependency.

**Fix**:
1. Added `MonoGame.Framework.DesktopGL` version `3.8.1.303` to `Directory.Packages.props`
2. Added explicit package reference in `LablabBean.Windows.csproj`

**Files Modified**:
- `dotnet/Directory.Packages.props` - Added MonoGame package version
- `dotnet/windows-app/LablabBean.Windows/LablabBean.Windows.csproj` - Added package reference

### Issue 2: Missing Logger Service Registration
**Error**:
```
System.InvalidOperationException: Unable to resolve service for type 'Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger`1[LablabBean.Game.SadConsole.Screens.GameScreen]'
```

**Root Cause**: The Windows app wasn't using the Generic Host pattern (unlike Console app), so logging services weren't automatically registered.

**Fix**: Added explicit logging service registration in `Program.cs`:
```csharp
services.AddLogging(builder =>
{
    builder.AddSerilog(dispose: true);
});
```

**Files Modified**:
- `dotnet/windows-app/LablabBean.Windows/Program.cs` - Added logging configuration and using statement

### Issue 3: SadConsole Initialization Timing
**Error**:
```
System.NullReferenceException at SadConsole.ScreenSurface..ctor
```

**Root Cause**: GameScreen was being instantiated before SadConsole.Game was fully initialized.

**Fix**: Moved GameScreen creation into the `Game.Instance.Started` event handler to ensure SadConsole is fully initialized first.

**Files Modified**:
- `dotnet/windows-app/LablabBean.Windows/Program.cs` - Changed initialization order

## Verification Results

### Console App Log
- Process running with PID: 47268
- Successfully initialized Terminal.Gui interface
- No errors or warnings in runtime

### Windows App Log

```

## Outstanding Warnings

### Minor Warning in GameWorldManager
```
warning CS9198: Parameter 'in Entity entity' reference kind modifier doesn't match target 'ref Entity t0Component'
```
- **File**: `dotnet/framework/LablabBean.Game.Core/Worlds/GameWorldManager.cs:72`
- **Impact**: Low - doesn't affect functionality
- **Action**: Can be addressed in future refactoring

## Conclusion

✅ **Both applications verified and running successfully**

All spec implementations (001-009) have not broken the existing application functionality. The Windows app required three fixes related to dependency management and initialization order, which have been resolved. Both apps are now stable and operational.

## Commands to Run Apps

### Console App
```powershell
cd dotnet/console-app/LablabBean.Console
dotnet run
```

### Windows App
