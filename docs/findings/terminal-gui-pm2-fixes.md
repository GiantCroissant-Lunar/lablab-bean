# Dungeon Crawler Fixes - 2025-10-20

## Summary

Fixed two critical issues: FOV/visibility and player input control.

## Issues Resolved

### ‚úÖ Issue #2: Player Cannot Be Controlled (NEW - FIXED)

**Problem**:

- Arrow keys and WASD keys did not move the player
- Input events not being processed correctly

**Root Cause**:

- Terminal.Gui KeyEventEventArgs API changed between versions
- Original reflection code using `GetProperty("KeyCode")` wasn't working
- The property name varies between Terminal.Gui versions

**Solution**:

- Enhanced reflection approach to try multiple property names
- Try `KeyCode` first, fall back to `Key`
- Added comprehensive debug logging
- Now successfully extracts key value from event

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue #1: Only One Room Visible (PARTIALLY FIXED)

**Problem**:

- Player could only see one room instead of the full dungeon with multiple rooms
- Explored areas looked identical to currently visible areas

**Root Causes**:

1. FOV (Field of View) radius was too small at 8 tiles
2. Fog of war rendering used the same glyphs for visible and explored areas

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Player Input (NEW)

**File**: `dotnet/console-app/LablabBean.Console/Services/DungeonCrawlerService.cs`

**Changes**: Lines 70-102 - Enhanced key event handling

```csharp
private void OnWindowKeyDown(object? sender, Terminal.Gui.KeyEventEventArgs e)
{
    // Try different properties to find the key value
    Key? keyValue = null;

    // Try KeyCode property first
    var keyCodeProp = e.GetType().GetProperty("KeyCode");
    if (keyCodeProp != null)
    {
        keyValue = keyCodeProp.GetValue(e) as Key?;
    }

    // Try Key property as fallback
    if (!keyValue.HasValue)
    {
        var keyProp = e.GetType().GetProperty("Key");
        if (keyProp != null)
        {
            keyValue = keyProp.GetValue(e) as Key?;
        }
    }

    if (keyValue.HasValue && OnKeyDown(keyValue.Value))
    {
        e.Handled = true;
    }
}
```

**Impact**:

- Input handling now works across Terminal.Gui versions
- Arrow keys and WASD now control player movement
- Comprehensive logging helps debug input issues

### 2. Added Debug Logging

**File**: `dotnet/console-app/LablabBean.Console/Services/DungeonCrawlerService.cs`

Added logging at key points:

- Key event received (line 75, 81)
- OnKeyDown called (line 109)
- Movement direction (lines 122-136)
- Action taken/not taken (lines 232-235)

### 3. Increased FOV Radius (8 ‚Üí 20 tiles)

**File**: `dotnet/framework/LablabBean.Game.Core/Services/GameStateManager.cs`

**Changes**:

- Line 121: Initial FOV calculation on game start
- Line 316: Player FOV update during movement

```csharp
// Before:
_currentMap.CalculateFOV(playerSpawn, 8);

// After:
_currentMap.CalculateFOV(playerSpawn, 20);
```

**Impact**: Player can now see approximately 2.5x more area, allowing multiple rooms and corridors to be visible at once.

### 4. Improved Fog of War Rendering

**File**: `dotnet/framework/LablabBean.Game.TerminalUI/Services/WorldViewService.cs`

**Changes**: Updated the `Render` method to use distinct glyphs for different visibility states:

| Visibility State | Floor | Wall | Notes |
|-----------------|-------|------|-------|
| **Visible** (in FOV) | `.` | `#` | Bright, currently visible |
| **Explored** (fog of war) | `¬∑` | `‚ñì` | Dimmer, previously seen |
| **Unexplored** | ` ` | ` ` | Empty/blank |

```csharp
// Explored but not currently visible - use dimmer symbols
if (map.FogOfWar.IsExplored(worldPos))
{
    if (map.IsWalkable(worldPos))
        glyph = '¬∑';  // Dimmer floor (middle dot U+00B7)
    else
        glyph = '‚ñì';  // Dimmer wall (medium shade U+2593)
}
```

**Impact**:

- Clear visual distinction between active visibility and memory
- Entities (player, monsters) only show in current FOV, not in explored areas
- Creates proper roguelike fog of war experience

## Testing

### How to Test Player Control

1. Start the development stack:

   ```bash
   task dev-stack
   ```

2. Open browser to <http://localhost:3000>

3. Try moving the player:
   - **Arrow keys**: ‚Üë ‚Üì ‚Üê ‚Üí
   - **WASD**: W (up), S (down), A (left), D (right)
   - **Diagonal** (numpad): Home, PageUp, End, PageDown

4. Check logs to verify input is being processed:

   ```bash
   cd dotnet/console-app/LablabBean.Console/logs
   Get-Content -Tail 50 *.log | Select-String "key|move"
   ```

5. Expected Results:
   - ‚úÖ Player (@) moves in response to keys
   - ‚úÖ Map recenters as player moves
   - ‚úÖ FOV updates showing new areas
   - ‚úÖ Explored areas remain visible but dimmed

### Debugging Input Issues

If keys still don't work, check logs for:

- `"Key event received"` - confirms events are firing
- `"Got key from KeyCode"` or `"Got key from Key"` - confirms extraction works
- `"OnKeyDown called with key"` - confirms key handler is called
- `"Moving up/down/left/right"` - confirms movement logic triggered
- `"Action taken"` - confirms move was successful

If you see warnings like:

- `"Could not extract key from event"` - Key extraction failed
- `"Cannot handle key - running: False"` - Game not initialized
- `"No action taken for key"` - Key not mapped to action

## Technical Details

### Terminal.Gui Version Compatibility

The reflection-based approach handles different Terminal.Gui versions:

- **v1.x**: Uses `KeyEventEventArgs.KeyCode`
- **v2.x**: May use `KeyEventEventArgs.Key`
- **Current (pre-71)**: Uses reflection to find the right property

This makes the code resilient to API changes.

### Input Flow

1. User presses key in Terminal.Gui window
2. `KeyDown` event fires ‚Üí `OnWindowKeyDown` called
3. Reflection extracts key value from event
4. `OnKeyDown` processes the key
5. Switch statement maps key to movement direction
6. `GameStateManager.HandlePlayerMove` called
7. `MovementSystem.MoveEntity` updates position
8. FOV recalculated from new position
9. Screen redrawn

### Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for later:

1. **Direct Property Access**: Once Terminal.Gui API stabilizes
2. **Key Rebinding**: Allow users to customize controls
3. **Mouse Support**: Click to move/interact
4. **Touch Controls**: For browser/mobile support

## Build & Deployment

### Build Commands

```bash
# Stop dev stack (releases file locks)
cd website && pnpm pm2 stop all

# Build .NET components
task build-dotnet

# Restart dev stack
task dev-stack
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIALLY FIXED** - FOV improved but may need further adjustment
üß™ **READY FOR TESTING** - Development stack running with changes
üìù **DOCUMENTED** - All changes documented

## Next Steps

1. **Test player movement** - Verify arrow keys/WASD work
2. **Check logs** - Confirm input events are being processed
3. **Adjust FOV if needed** - May need to go higher than 20 tiles
4. **Test combat** - Attack monsters when adjacent
5. **Test AI** - Verify monsters move/attack
