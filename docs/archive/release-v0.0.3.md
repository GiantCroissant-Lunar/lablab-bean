# Release v0.0.3 - Player Movement Functional üéÆ

**Release Date:** 2025-10-20
**Tag:** v0.0.3
**Status:** ‚úÖ Player movement working, dungeon fully explorable

---

## üéâ Major Milestone

**The player can now move and explore the dungeon!**

After extensive debugging and Terminal.Gui API investigation, player movement is now fully functional with arrow keys and WASD controls.

---

## ‚ú® New Features

### 1. **Player Movement** üéÆ

- Arrow keys (‚Üë ‚Üì ‚Üê ‚Üí) control movement
- WASD keys also work
- Map recenters on player position
- FOV updates as player explores
- Smooth dungeon exploration

### 2. **Debug Log Panel** üîç

- Real-time debug panel at bottom of screen
- Bright yellow text for visibility
- Shows all keyboard events
- Displays game state changes
- Essential for troubleshooting

### 3. **Enhanced FOV** üëÅÔ∏è

- Field of view radius increased from 8 to 20 tiles
- Multiple rooms visible at once
- Better strategic overview
- Corridors clearly visible

### 4. **Improved Fog of War** üå´Ô∏è

- Visible areas: `.` (floor) `#` (wall)
- Explored areas: `¬∑` (floor) `‚ñì` (wall)
- Unexplored: blank
- Clear visual distinction between states

## üêõ Bugs Fixed

### Critical: Keyboard Input Not Working

**Root Cause:**
Terminal.Gui v2 pre-71 changed the keyboard event API. The key is accessed via `e.KeyEvent.KeyValue` (an integer) instead of `e.Key` or `e.KeyCode`.

**Solution:**

1. Added debug panel to inspect events in real-time
2. Used reflection to discover `KeyEvent.KeyValue` property
3. Implemented integer-to-Key enum conversion
4. Added fallbacks for other Terminal.Gui versions

**Files Changed:**

- `DungeonCrawlerService.cs` - Enhanced key extraction with reflection

### Critical: HUD Stealing Keyboard Focus

**Root Cause:**
ListView in the HUD was capturing focus, preventing the game window from receiving keyboard input.

**Solution:**

1. Set `CanFocus = false` on HUD FrameView
2. Set `CanFocus = false` on ListView
3. Game window calls `SetFocus()` after layout and updates

**Files Changed:**

- `HudService.cs` - Focus management
- `DungeonCrawlerService.cs` - SetFocus() calls

### Minor: Limited Visibility

**Changes:**

- Increased FOV radius from 8 to 20 tiles
- Adjusted layout to accommodate debug panel
- Improved glyph selection for fog of war

**Files Changed:**

- `GameStateManager.cs` - FOV radius
- `WorldViewService.cs` - Rendering and layout
- `WorldViewService.cs` - Fog of war glyphs

## üß™ Testing

### How to Test

1. **Start the dev stack:**

   ```bash
   task dev-stack
   ```

2. **Open browser:**

   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. **Test movement:**
   - Press arrow keys (‚Üë ‚Üì ‚Üê ‚Üí)
   - Press WASD keys
   - Player (@) should move immediately
   - Map should recenter on player
   - FOV should update showing new areas

4. **Observe debug panel:**
   - Watch bottom panel for key events
   - Verify "Extracted Key from KeyValue: [key]"
   - Verify "OnKeyDown: [key]"
   - Verify "Moving [direction]"
   - Verify "Action taken, updating game"

### Expected Results

- ‚úÖ Player moves smoothly in all directions
- ‚úÖ Map recenters to keep player in view
- ‚úÖ Multiple rooms visible (FOV 20 tiles)
- ‚úÖ Fog of war shows explored areas
- ‚úÖ Debug panel shows all input events
- ‚úÖ No lag or delays in movement

## üîß Technical Details

### Key Extraction Process

```csharp
// Terminal.Gui v2 pre-71 API structure:
e.KeyEvent.KeyValue -> int -> cast to Key enum

// Fallback for other versions:
e.KeyCode -> Key (older versions)
e.Key -> Key (possible future versions)
```

### Input Flow

1. User presses key in browser terminal
2. xterm.js captures and sends to PTY server
3. PTY forwards to Terminal.Gui console app
4. `KeyDown` event fires on game window
5. `OnWindowKeyDown` extracts key via reflection
6. `OnKeyDown` maps key to movement direction
7. `GameStateManager.HandlePlayerMove` updates position
8. FOV recalculated from new position
9. Screen redrawn with updated view

### Debug Panel Architecture

- TextView with bright yellow color scheme
- Bottom-aligned (10 lines high)
- Keeps last 100 log entries
- Auto-scrolls to latest message
- Can be focused for text selection
- Also mirrors to HUD message list

## üéØ What's Next

### Ready for Testing

- ‚úÖ Player movement
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Combat system (implemented but not tested)

- [ ] Configurable FOV radius
- [ ] Toggle-able debug panel (F12?)
- [ ] Mouse support for movement
- [ ] Minimap view
