## 🎬 Media Player Plugin Status

### Expected Media Player Plugins

Based on the published artifacts, the following media player plugins should be available:

```
1. LablabBean.Plugins.MediaPlayer.Core
2. LablabBean.Plugins.MediaPlayer.FFmpeg
3. LablabBean.Plugins.MediaPlayer.Terminal.Braille
4. LablabBean.Plugins.MediaPlayer.Terminal.Kitty
5. LablabBean.Plugins.MediaPlayer.Terminal.Sixel
```

### ⚠️ Observation

**Media player plugins were NOT discovered in this test run.**

#### Possible Causes

1. **Plugin Naming Pattern**: Media player plugins may use a different naming convention
2. **Plugin Directory**: May be in a different subdirectory
3. **Plugin Manifest**: May need to check plugin.json files
4. **Discovery Pattern**: Plugin loader may be filtering by pattern

#### Next Steps

To verify media player plugins are present:

```powershell
# Check if media player plugin directories exist
Get-ChildItem "build\_artifacts\0.0.4-021-unified-media-player.1\publish\console\plugins" -Filter "*MediaPlayer*"

# Check plugin manifests
Get-ChildItem "build\_artifacts\0.0.4-021-unified-media-player.1\publish\console\plugins\*MediaPlayer*\plugin.json"

# Run with verbose logging to see discovery details
task run:media-player -- --verbose
```

## 🎯 Recommended Next Tests

### 1. Verify Media Player Plugins Are Discoverable

```powershell
# Check plugin directories
Get-ChildItem "build\_artifacts\0.0.4-021-unified-media-player.1\publish\console\plugins" | Where-Object Name -like "*MediaPlayer*"
```

### 2. Check Plugin Manifests

```powershell
# Verify plugin.json files exist
Get-ChildItem "build\_artifacts\0.0.4-021-unified-media-player.1\publish\console\plugins\*MediaPlayer*\plugin.json" -Recurse
```

### 3. Test Plugin Discovery with Specific Pattern

```powershell
# If there's a plugins command
task run:media-player -- plugins list --all
task run:media-player -- plugins list --pattern MediaPlayer
```

### 4. Test Media Player Functionality (Once Plugins Confirmed)

```powershell
# Test basic media player operations
task run:media-player -- media play --help
task run:media-player -- media list-renderers
```

## 🏆 Overall Assessment

### Grade: **B+**

**Strengths:**

- ✅ Task command integration works perfectly
- ✅ Versioned artifact execution successful
- ✅ Plugin system functioning correctly
- ✅ Excellent performance metrics
- ✅ Low memory footprint
- ✅ Fast plugin loading times

**Areas for Investigation:**

- ⚠️ Media player plugins not discovered (need to verify cause)
