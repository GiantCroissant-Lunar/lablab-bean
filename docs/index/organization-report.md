# Documentation Organization Report

*Generated: 2025-10-26T02:14:29.261691+00:00*

## Summary

This report documents the automatic organization of scattered markdown and text files
according to the R-DOC-001 rule.

### Files Moved (4)

- `PHASE5_STATUS.txt` → `docs\_inbox\PHASE5_STATUS.txt`
- `PHASE6_DASHBOARD.txt` → `docs\_inbox\PHASE6_DASHBOARD.txt`
- `PHASE6_US3_SUMMARY.txt` → `docs\_inbox\PHASE6_US3_SUMMARY.txt`
- `TASK_5.15_COMPLETE.txt` → `docs\_inbox\TASK_5.15_COMPLETE.txt`

## Organization Rules Applied

- **R-DOC-001**: New docs go to `docs/_inbox/` first
- Files with proper `doc_type` front-matter moved to appropriate subdirectories
- Files without front-matter moved to `docs/_inbox/`
- Cross-references updated where possible

## Next Steps

1. Review files in `docs/_inbox/` and add proper front-matter
2. Move files from inbox to appropriate categories
3. Run `python scripts/validate_docs.py` to validate organization
4. Update any remaining broken cross-references
