# Documentation Organization Report

*Generated: 2025-10-27T13:06:12.774671+00:00*

## Summary

This report documents the automatic organization of scattered markdown and text files
according to the R-DOC-001 rule.

### Files Moved (1)

- `docs\archive\quicktype-mapperly-implementation-2025-10-27.md` → `docs\findings\quicktype-mapperly-implementation-2025-10-27.md`

## Organization Rules Applied

- **R-DOC-001**: New docs go to `docs/_inbox/` first
- Files with proper `doc_type` front-matter moved to appropriate subdirectories
- Files without front-matter moved to `docs/_inbox/`
- Cross-references updated where possible

## Next Steps

1. Review files in `docs/_inbox/` and add proper front-matter
2. Move files from inbox to appropriate categories
3. Run `python scripts/validate_docs.py` to validate organization
4. Update any remaining broken cross-references
