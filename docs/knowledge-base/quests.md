## Legendary Quests

### The Dragonbane Sword

**Source**: Ancient Legends
**Status**: Unverified

After Aethon the Bold defeated Draconus with the legendary Dragonbane Sword, the weapon vanished. Some say Aethon hid it, fearing its power. Others claim it was stolen. Fragments of ancient texts suggest the sword may be hidden in one of three locations:

1. The depths of the Crystal Palace in Silverpeak
2. Sealed within Draconus's hoard in the Dragon's Lair
3. Lost in the Ruins of Old Thornhaven

Many have sought the sword. None have found it. Some who search for it never return.
