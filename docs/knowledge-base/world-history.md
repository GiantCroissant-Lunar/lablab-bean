# The History of the Eternal Realm

## The Age of Dragons

Long before mortal races walked the lands, the Eternal Realm was ruled by the Ancient Dragons. These magnificent creatures possessed wisdom beyond measure and power that could reshape mountains. The most powerful among them was **Draconus the Eternal**, a dragon of silver scales whose breath could freeze time itself.

For millennia, Draconus maintained peace and balance across the realm. Under his watchful eye, magic flourished, and the first civilizations began to emerge. The dragons taught mortals the ways of magic, craftsmanship, and governance.

## The Great Betrayal

Around 1000 years ago, everything changed. A human warrior named **Aethon the Bold** discovered an ancient artifact known as the **Dragonbane Sword**. Legend says the sword was forged by the gods themselves, specifically designed to challenge draconic dominion.

Aethon, driven by ambition and a desire to free humanity from dragon rule, challenged Draconus in single combat. The battle lasted three days and three nights, shaking the very foundations of the realm. In the end, Aethon struck the final blow, and Draconus fell.

## The Age of Mortals

With the Ancient Dragons' power broken, mortal races rose to prominence. Three great kingdoms emerged:

### The Kingdom of Lumina

Located in the northern mountains, Lumina is known for its skilled craftsmen and mighty fortifications. The capital city of **Silverpeak** is built into the mountainside itself, with towers reaching towards the sky. Lumina's current ruler is **Queen Elara the Wise**.

### The Merchant Republic of Portshire

Controlling the southern coasts, Portshire is a nation of traders and seafarers. The port city of **Harborton** is the busiest trading hub in the realm, where goods from distant lands exchange hands daily. The Republic is governed by the **Council of Merchants**, led by **High Councilor Thaddeus Goldwater**.

### The Mystical Federation of Arcanis

In the eastern forests lies Arcanis, a confederation of wizard towers and magical academies. Here, the study of magic is paramount, and the most talented mages from across the realm come to study. The **Archmage Meridian** currently leads the Federation from the **Celestial Spire**.

## The Dragon's Legacy

Though the Age of Dragons has passed, their legacy remains. Dragon artifacts are highly sought after, possessing incredible magical power. Ruins of ancient dragon lairs dot the landscape, filled with treasures and dangers alike.

Some scholars believe that Draconus was not truly slain but merely sleeps, waiting for the day when the realm needs him once more. In the mountains near Silverpeak, locals report sightings of silver scales glinting in the moonlight...

## The Current Era

The realm now stands at a crossroads. Old alliances fray as new powers emerge. Strange creatures have been spotted near the borders, and whispers speak of a growing darkness in the far east. Heroes are needed now more than ever to face whatever challenges lie ahead.
