# Notable Locations in the Eternal Realm

## Major Cities

### Silverpeak (Capital of Lumina)

**Location**: Northern Mountains
**Population**: ~50,000
**Ruler**: Queen Elara the Wise

Silverpeak is a marvel of dwarven and human engineering, built directly into the mountainside. The city consists of seven distinct levels, each carved into the rock and connected by a series of grand staircases and mechanical lifts.

**Key Landmarks**:

- **The Crystal Palace**: Home to Queen Elara, this palace is known for its massive crystal windows that catch the morning light
- **The Forge District**: Home to the realm's finest smiths and craftsmen

### Harborton (Portshire Capital)

**Location**: Southern Coast
**Population**: ~80,000
**Government**: Council of Merchants

Harborton is the beating heart of commerce in the Eternal Realm. Ships from distant lands dock here daily, bringing exotic goods, spices, and tales from far away. The city sprawls along the coastline, with districts devoted to different trades.

**Key Landmarks**:

- **The Grand Bazaar**: A massive marketplace where anything can be bought or sold
- **Lighthouse of the Ancients**: A 200-foot tall lighthouse built during the Age of Dragons

### Celestial Spire (Arcanis Capital)

**Location**: Eastern Forests
**Population**: ~30,000 (mostly mages and scholars)
**Ruler**: Archmage Meridian

The Celestial Spire is unlike any other city in the realm. The central tower rises impossibly high into the clouds, held aloft by powerful magic. Smaller towers and floating platforms surround it, connected by magical bridges of light.

**Key Landmarks**:

- **The Celestial Spire**: The main tower, housing the most advanced magical research
- **The Library of Infinite Tomes**: Said to contain every book ever written
- **The Enchanting Quarter**: Where magical items are created and sold
- **The Astral Observatory**: Used to study the stars and divine the future

## Dangerous Regions

### The Withered Wastes

Once fertile farmland, this region was blighted by dark magic during the War of Shadows 200 years ago. Strange creatures now roam here, and few who enter return.

**Notable Features**:

- Perpetual grey mist
- Twisted, dead vegetation
- Ruins of the ancient city of Thornhaven
- Reported sightings of undead

### The Dragon's Lair Mountains

The former home of Draconus the Eternal, these mountains are treacherous and filled with dragon-era traps and guardians. Treasure hunters regularly venture here, though few strike it rich.

**Notable Features**:

- Draconus's primary lair at the peak of Mount Eternal
- Ancient dragon runes and magical wards
- Pockets of temporal distortion (time moves differently)
- Valuable dragon scales and artifacts

### The Whispering Woods

An ancient forest where magic runs wild. The trees themselves are said to be sentient, and travelers report hearing voices and seeing visions. The Druids of the Old Circle maintain a few safe paths through the forest.

**Notable Features**:

- Talking trees and magical wildlife
- The Grove of the Ancients (Druid sanctuary)
- Portal stones leading to the Feywild
- Rare magical herbs and components

## Places of Interest

### The Crossroads Inn

**Location**: Center of the Realm, at the junction of major trade routes
**Owner**: Garrick Stoneheart (Retired Adventurer)

A neutral ground where travelers from all kingdoms meet. Known for excellent ale, hearty meals, and a strict "no fighting" policy enforced by Garrick himself. The inn's walls are decorated with trophies from Garrick's adventuring days.

### The Ruins of Old Thornhaven

Once a prosperous city, Thornhaven fell during the War of Shadows. The ruins are said to be haunted, but also contain valuable magical artifacts from before the war. The city's grand library remained mostly intact, though corrupted by dark magic.

### The Floating Markets

Mobile markets that travel between cities on giant magical platforms. Run by gnomish merchants, these markets offer rare and exotic goods from across the realm and beyond. They appear in each major city once per season.
