# Windows App Reporting Integration - Implementation Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Phase 1-3 Implemented

## Overview

Successfully integrated reporting capabilities into the Windows app to track gameplay session metrics (kills, deaths, levels, items) and export session reports.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Reporting Dependencies

**File**: `dotnet/windows-app/LablabBean.Windows/LablabBean.Windows.csproj`

Added project references for:

- `LablabBean.Reporting.Contracts` - Core reporting contracts
- `LablabBean.Reporting.Analytics` - Analytics providers
- `LablabBean.Plugins.Reporting.Html` - HTML report renderer
- `LablabBean.Plugins.Reporting.Csv` - CSV report renderer
- `LablabBean.SourceGenerators.Reporting` - Source generator for auto-registration

### 2. Created Session Metrics Collector

**File**: `dotnet/windows-app/LablabBean.Windows/Services/SessionMetricsCollector.cs`

A new service that:

- Tracks session metrics (kills, deaths, levels, items, dungeons)
- Generates unique session IDs
- Tracks session duration
- Calculates K/D ratio
- Exports session data to JSON format
- Logs session summary on disposal

**Metrics Tracked**:

- `TotalKills` - Enemies defeated
- `TotalDeaths` - Player deaths
- `LevelsCompleted` - Dungeon levels completed
- `ItemsCollected` - Items picked up
- `DungeonsCompleted` - Full dungeon runs completed
- Session start/end time and duration
- K/D ratio calculation

### 3. Registered Reporting Services

**File**: `dotnet/windows-app/LablabBean.Windows/Program.cs`

Added DI registrations:

```csharp
services.AddTransient<SessionStatisticsProvider>();
services.AddTransient<PluginHealthProvider>();
services.AddSingleton<SessionMetricsCollector>();
```

### 4. Hooked Combat Events

**File**: `dotnet/windows-app/LablabBean.Windows/Program.cs`

Integrated metrics collection with combat system:

- Subscribed to `CombatSystem.OnEntityDied` event
- Tracks player deaths when Player entity dies
- Tracks enemy kills when Enemy entity dies
- Logs metrics updates to Serilog

### 5. Export Reports on Exit

**File**: `dotnet/windows-app/LablabBean.Windows/Program.cs`

Added shutdown handler:

- Exports session report to JSON before app exit
- Report path: `build/_artifacts/{version}/reports/sessions/windows-session-{timestamp}.json`
- Version is automatically detected from assembly metadata
- Handles errors gracefully with logging
- Disposes metrics collector properly

### 6. Exposed CombatSystem Property

**File**: `dotnet/framework/LablabBean.Game.Core/Services/GameStateManager.cs`

Added public property:

```csharp
public CombatSystem CombatSystem => _combatSystem;
```

This allows external code (like Program.cs) to subscribe to combat events.

## Session Report Format

Reports are exported as JSON files with the following structure:

```json
{
  "SessionId": "guid",
  "Version": "0.1.0",
  "StartTime": "2025-10-23T05:00:00Z",
  "EndTime": "2025-10-23T05:30:00Z",
  "DurationMinutes": 30.0,
  "Stats": {
    "TotalKills": 42,
    "TotalDeaths": 3,
    "LevelsCompleted": 5,
    "ItemsCollected": 18,
    "DungeonsCompleted": 1,
    "KDRatio": 14.0
  }
}
```

### Directory Structure

Reports are organized by version in the build artifacts:

```
build/
└── _artifacts/
    └── {version}/          # e.g., "0.1.0" or "0.2.0-alpha.1"
        ├── publish/        # Published binaries
        ├── logs/           # Build logs
        ├── test-results/   # Test results
        └── reports/        # All reports for this version
            ├── build-metrics-*.html      # Build-time metrics
            ├── plugin-metrics-*.html     # Plugin health
            └── sessions/                 # Runtime session reports
                ├── windows-session-20251023-051530.json
                ├── windows-session-20251023-062145.json
                └── console-session-20251023-073020.json
```

Benefits:

- **Version Isolation**: Each version has its own report directory
- **Complete Artifacts**: Build contains both build-time AND runtime reports
- **Easy Comparison**: Compare performance across versions
- **CI/CD Ready**: Artifacts are self-contained and versioned

## Build Status

✅ **Windows App builds successfully** with 0 errors, 1 warning (pre-existing in GameWorldManager.cs)

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

### Phase 4: Track Additional Events

- **Items Collected**: Hook `InventorySystem` pickup events
- **Levels Completed**: Add event to `LevelManager` for level transitions
- **Dungeon Runs**: Track full dungeon completions from start to finish

### Phase 5: In-Game Features

- Add in-game UI for "Export Report" menu option
- Real-time stats display in HUD
- Session comparison (track multiple sessions)

### Phase 6: Build Integration

- Add Windows app to Nuke `Compile` target (currently commented out due to prior compilation errors - now fixed!)
- Generate build-time metrics (assembly size, dependencies, build duration)
- Include Windows app reports in `GenerateReports` target

### Optional Enhancements

- Real-time plugin health dashboard
- Performance profiler (FPS, memory) visualization
- Auto-export on crash for debugging
- Historical session tracking and analytics

## Testing Checklist

To test the implementation:

1. ✅ Build Windows app successfully
2. ⬜ Run Windows app and play a session
3. ⬜ Verify metrics logged during gameplay:
   - Enemy kills increment `TotalKills`
   - Player deaths increment `TotalDeaths`
4. ⬜ Exit the app and verify report export:
   - Check `build/_artifacts/{version}/reports/sessions/` directory
   - Verify JSON file with correct session data and version
5. ⬜ Verify session summary logged on exit

## Dependencies Added

No new NuGet packages required - all dependencies are internal project references.

## Breaking Changes

None. All changes are additive and don't affect existing functionality.

## Performance Impact

Minimal:

- Event subscriptions: O(1) overhead per death event
- Metric tracking: Simple integer increments
- Report export: Only on app shutdown (async, non-blocking)
